Samples here:

SNAP         
Snap is a beautiful full bodied redhead who would get all the boys excited in the highschool yard. Her ditsy and friendly nature made her a prime target for moody teenagers hopped up on hormones. Everyday she would open her locker, gasp at stack upon stacks of photos of her classmates in various state of undress and proceed to shove in all into the garbage bin.          

Despite her cheerful demeaner, she was hiding deep financial troubles. To prevent hurt feelings, her locker had reached the size of three full sized aircraft hangers costing millions in leases a year. Desperate for income, she had to find a benefactor, and fast.          

Having overheard of her desperation, Facebook, a local wealthy business man offered to make a deal and suggested they meet in his office.           

As she entered his office, she found a blank check being tossed in her direction. Slightly dazed at the prospect, she probed Facebook's eye and saw an animalistic hunger. Slightly unerved and alarmed, she quickly glanced towards the doorway. Within that instant, Facebook lunged towards her, pinning her to the ground and tore off her top. Screaming and crying at the top of her lungs, desperation sank in for SNAP as Facebook started probing her insides with his fingers (for synergies). Yet for a brief moment before a merger could be completed, a distant police siren distracted her attacker which gave her the moment to dash for the door. Outside, Half naked, cold and desperate, she would soon turn to a life of vice on the (wall)street.         

For the next year or so, she would let strange men exchange her (equity). Her insides would whither in pain from the constant churn of (retail volume) clients. She needed stability, someone who would hold (a strategic stake in) her. The last anyone saw of her was her entering a Mustang with a Massachusetts license plate driven by an Asian man, never to be seen again.          

ROKU      
Roku is like the petite bouncey teenager in a light tank top when suddenly three large studs burst into her house named Apple, Google and Amazon. She tries to run but is quickly cornered and hides her eyes when the studs start revealing their large members(shipbase). She is both horrified and beguiled at the same time by the massive length and girth (of their balance sheets). With her defenses breaking down, she starts leaking (cashflow) non-stop and is soon gasping for breath as the three work their way through churning her (customer base) inside out.",2017-11-22

Roku was up 320% from its IPO price before dropping 34% from its 52wk high after crappy Q4 earnings. 

- ROKU is currently the leading OS for TV streaming, but has major competition from FireTV, AppleTV, AndroidTV. Simply put: the latter got mo' money. 
- They've been able to monetize by: advertising, subscriptions through ROKU, brand buttons on their remotes, etc. Growth is expected to grow from 29% to 32% guidance in 2018
- Past Performance: Annual ARPU growth by 48% and platform revenue by 138% over the past year.

Now the big one...lockup expiry

- Roku's 180 day IPO lockup is set to expire end of March 27th
- about 20 million shares outstanding, $14 IPO....current price ~$36. the concern is insiders wanting to sell to lock in gains and consequently tanking the price.


What would your plays be for this? I'm considering buying some puts until the expiry date, and then waiting for the reversal to buy some calls. I am bullish in the long term on ROKU. ",2018-03-15

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.

A quick google of ""Roku subscriber growth"" and you will see headlines of 48&#37;, 61&#37; etc. from 2017 to 2018 quarterly articles. This sounds great. But maybe too great. They are pretty late to the game, something has to give.

Last weekend I went to WallyWorld and bought a $300 50"" 4k TV from some company I never heard of for my outdoor kitchen and got herpes from the checkout girl.  My thought is it will get fucked so might as well buy a cheap TV and replace it when it shits the bed, lightening, rain, drunk dude, etc.  The cheap TV makes you sign up on Roku and you have to go through a Roku account to get to the cable box HDMI  source to watch TV. Now this shows you being a Roku subscriber and you are an active account. But you are not. You are just watching two fags on ESPN yell at each other about if LeBron is a leader on your cable provider and not giving any money to Roku. 

Since this is a cheap shit TV from the largest brick and whitetrash store, how many fucking Roku accounts out there are BS? Someone just made an account to get into the TV to get to cable, air tv, or other platforms like AMZN, Netflix, Hulu, xBox, Playstation, etc. and Roku acting like they are ""active users"".

Also, AMCX has some great IP (Breaking Bad, Walking Dead) and interesting shows in the pipeline that will benefit Netflix, especially when Disney and other companies eventually start pulling their content off of Netflix. If (when) the Disney Fox buyout goes through, Disney's streaming service is going to be a **beast**. Netflix has to bulk up now ($AMCX) and diversify revenue sources ($AMC).  Netflix will be laughing all the way to the bank when Disney has to pay them to play Frozen 2 in theaters.

8x29y0,22,130,StockMarket,Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days),0.95,1531093273.0,1531064473.0,"
This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

8y05ji,102,454,wallstreetbets,A few of my trading strategies for discussion,0.97,1531348921.0,1531320121.0,"There have been some posts recently about this sub not being true to its name. While I do enjoy the gifs, I decided to add some content. My descriptions below are generally very high level, but I'll gladly dive into details if anyone has questions. While the numbers aren't big, most of this is generally speaking a bet for me. I hope to continue to grow my account and bet larger amounts over time.

My account: https://imgur.com/a/0aqy6i5

**General strategy:**

I started with about $2k and then added another $6k to trade with about $8k overall. In a few months I traded up to $16k and have removed everything except $4k. So now I'm just playing with house money. Below I have captured my strategies. Overall my strategies are to sell put spreads on strong stocks any time there is a dip, or to buy weeklies on really strong stocks any time there is a natural dip less than 1%. Anything more than 1% and I get nervous about it continuing to dip or holding for an extended period of time. Also, I always leave about 30% of my account in cash. This way I can buy large dips. Very rarely have I been 100% invested and it's usually only for a short period of time until positions start closing.

I started by trading SPY calls and puts in RH. I would attempt to swing trade during some of the volatility, but I was terrible at it, didn't have enough time or money to buy anything more than OTM weeklies, and the RH interface blows so I switched to a simpler strategy of buying 100 shares of XLK and then selling covered calls. I quickly got bored with this so I started buying XLK calls, and the market went down on the trade war crap. So I took this an an opportunity to switch brokers to tastyworks and I kept buying more XLK calls, all about 2-3 months out. I sat on them for awhile until we had a rally and I was about $2k positive on 10-ish calls. I easily could have blew up my account right away but got a bit lucky by being patient. The learning experience here was to really be patient while the underlying stocks fluctuate in price.

Meanwhile, I wanted to practice some other strategies. My overall strategy is to remain bullish. The market always goes up slower than it goes down, but it consistently goes up and it's really difficult to predict when it is going to go down, unless you're buddies with Trump I guess. One stock I have in my don't-touch-it portfolio is Visa. This beast seems to continue to rise over time and cannot be stopped. I started selling put spreads on Visa. Anytime Visa is red, even for just a little bit, I sell a put spread that has roughly a 60-70% chance of profit according to TW. Then I set a limit sell for 60% profit. I rinse and repeat this constantly. So far I'm up a little over $800 the past few months with Visa and opening conservative positions. I plan on continuing to do this with more and more money over time. Right now I'm holding Sept 21 140C, which I plan on rolling profits higher and higher as time moves, if Visa keeps going up.

For my more ""aggressive"" strategies, I tend to trade AMZN on any sort of weakness with weeklies, typically on Thursdays as this gives me a day of recovery. I watch for a .3% to .6% drop on AMZN. Anything more than .6% and I just keep adding slightly-OTM calls if I can afford it. One of these times it's going to just keep dropping and I'll lose everything, but till then it's fine, right?. All I do with the weeklies is watch, and again shoot for a 60% profit on the positions. The key here is to take any profit once it shows itself. Do not think that it will just keep going up and you'll make more money because it can drop at any moment. One day I really wasn't paying attention and opened up a position at 3:59pm. I honestly had lost track of time and heard the closing bell immediately after the position filled. I had to sit with $8k of next-day-expiring OTM calls on AMZN. I barely slept since this was more than my entire profit for the year at the time. I was super lucky that AMZN opened up a decent amount and I made a few k profit quickly. If I had held all day, like Chad, I'd have more than doubled my position. But again, my strategy is to take profits when I get them, and let losers ride.

ROKU and PYPL. Both of these are promising stocks and I tend to also trade them on weakness. However I limit my positions with them and thus have only earned about $110 and $180 respectively. If there is a strong dip on some news, I snag a call and set a limit sell for about $100. For these I tend to buy slightly-OTM calls and I rarely trade because it's difficult to keep up with these stocks all the time. Something about a day job...

SPY: I pretty much only buy protective puts with SPY. They're cheap, and they keep my account balanced on bad days. Just today I sold my PUTs for a net loss, but a daily gain which is helping me to generate profit on what has been a red day so far. I do this anytime the market is up a bit and I buy just enough to balance out the delta on my account. As such, I've done nothing but lose money on SPY, but it's also saved me on some pretty red days. I guess overall I'd probably be up another $600 if I never did it, but that's the price I pay for protection.

**Trades that went to shit:**

SBUX: I hate this stock. After the first dip that was caused by the CEO retiring I picked up a call just to test the over-reaction of the market. I quickly made some money but regretted not buying more calls so I got greedy and picked up some more. The price came back down and I closed out my position for a net wash. Shortly after, SBUX dropped even more with the news of stores closing. Around $55 I picked up a call and, well, it just kept dropping. Overall with SBUX I'm down $400 this year. Again, not much, but I try to compound little gains over time.

TWTR: I tried to swing trade the recent news and lost out about $220 because I was weak. It came back up immediately after I sold, but now it's back down so whatever, time to move on.

RIG: I bought a handful of $10 puts on this around $12. I had planned on holding them for months, but I seriously got bored of it going from $12-14 over and over so I just closed it all out for a $500 loss and moved on with my life. If I want to hold something for a long time, I open the position in my ROTH IRA.

**Boring trades that worked out:**

AMAT: After earnings I bought 100 shares and sold a covered call for 52.5. When the call was close to expiring I closed everything for a $441 profit and have since watched AMAT be a total piece of shit. Probably won't touch this stock anymore.

QQQ: I continue to sell put spreads on QQQ and I continue to make a tiny amount of money. Probably not even worth it as it barely covers the commission. Seems it might be better to sell put spreads on AMZN.

91j6nt,187,434,investing,"Motley Fool is Hyping a ""Califorina company"" with a claickbaitiy ""This Stock Could Be Like Buying Netflix for $1.87..."" sales pitch...",0.9,1532480373.0,1532451573.0,"So to spare you the link Motley fool is trying to get people onboard by promoting an up and coming cord cutting service. Of course they arent telling what it is so you get on their money wagon. 

What they do say:

* California company. 
* In the markets of cable cutting  (ditching cable TV in favor of streaming service alternatives)
* NOT a Streaming company, but compares it to being ""instead the gold digger, the one selling the picks and shovels"" so probably some sort of middle management akin to something like Roku.
* Big moneybag investors are quietly buying it.  

So rather than jump in like an idiot, I've been looking around trying to find this supposed cash cow company, and all i seem to find is nothing. This instantly strikes me as suspicious. Why wouldn't a promising company have their name on google for me to find? So my next step was checking out /r/cordcutters. They know their way around this market, and whatever may be new and coming, yet I havent found anything there either. Frankly after a couple hours searching the closest thing I can find that fits the bill is Roku, which well isn't promising in the least. So I'm posting all of this to share my scepticism in this. That and the very unlikely chance there's actually something here in all this. ",2018-07-24

Icahn calls the deal a ""folly"" and that it carries a ""ridiculous"" price tag, and adds that Amazon.com represents an ""existential threat"" to pharmacy benefit managers.

96blr6,16,38,wallstreetbets,ROKU write-up,0.89,1533969666.0,1533940866.0,"Well, it's 5:30pm on Friday, I know you fags are all worn out from your 9-5 at Burger King, thought I would give you a little Friday reading.

So ROKU had a killer quarter as most of us know. I have been excited about ROKU for a while now, posting a couple of very optimistic DDs. Posted one DD back at $48 but one of the mods deleted it about 10 minutes later for god knows what reason, so if your bank account is looking a little short this week, that's the reason.

Let's talk about the company:

**The Founder:**

Anthony Wood is this British-born guy who has been in Silicon Valley since the dot com bubble, had a successful exit with his first company ReplayTV(an early Tivo competitor), and proceeded to found ROKU in 2002. To summarize: this guy has been around and successfully building his baby company from nothing to a $5B company for 16 years. That is what I like to see. He has been extraordinarily patient in making his billions. He retains a stake of 27% in the company, so he has some serious skin in the game. He is also a total straight-shooter. Everything I like to see. You bet on the jockey not the horse, and this is one jockey that I would like to ride.

**The business:**

ROKU is a ""sell the hardware, monetize the software"" kind of business. This kind of business is extremely lucrative if done right. Apple would be a good example of this (except that they also make fucktons of money from their hardware). SQ is kind of another example, where they sell their card reader and then try and lock you into their ecosystem. SQ faces competitive pricing from other processors, but on their ecosystem services, the profit has no limits. This is like ROKU, they face competitive pressures on the box, but not on the advertising. ROKU will be able to increasingly squeeze their partners as their market share increases(because it's not the customer who buys the box who pays the cost)..

ROKU is one of these companies that has leveraged their access to the customer in order to build new products that the customer will enjoy. This is the big thing in tech right now; the reason that AGA is so successful, in a nutshell. The main example is the ROKU channel, but more historical examples would include their app store, moving from boxes into sticks and TV licensing, and etc. The ROKU channel was recently valued by Laura Martin from Needham at $1B. Imagine building a $1B television channel in a single year, because you fucking sell people a box. Astounding. What will they think of next?

Another fantastic sign is that they are just blowing out estimates every single quarter. It can't continue forever, but it's a very promising sign. And upgrades, and upward valuations on their assets like ROKU channel, it's clear that people underestimated this one and will continue to do so.

People who use ROKU products like the products. They are doing it right. They are successfully competing, and winning. Now is not the time to get worried, but to get greedy. Can AMZN and GOOG slide in some features on their product that nobody else has? Yes. Will it cause people to throw out their $199 TV and buy another different $199 stick? Probably not. 

**Moat**

Here, you have a product where there is not a huge amount of differentiation, but you have network effects. This creates a kind of winner-take-all effect. It's not nearly as extreme as something like FB, but it does exist. One network effect is that ROKU got on all the TVs before everybody else. The TVs get marketed by the manufacturers as ROKU TVs, and everybody hears about it. Another network effect is that ROKU now has a lot of consumer data-- probably the reason the ROKU channel is getting so popular so fast. The eventual goal is to build a bigger ecosystem that draws more and more people onto ROKU and creates a durable competitive advantage. That is a possibility, but I won't venture to say it will probably happen. The other thing is called ""cost of developers,"" as Ben Thompson calls it. The more scale, the lower the cost of developers. That is why MSFT was so successful. 

ROKU is also the Switzerland of this space. They will partner with everybody and that is conceivably a big advantage. Content providers would rather partner with it than AMZN or GOOG, who compete with them on content. 

**Valuation**

You can make a DCF to get any numbers you want, but we like to look for asymmetric upside. I think it's pretty clear where the asymmetric upside is coming from here-- a long string of years where they grow ARPU at 40% and/or users at 40%. The downside is that the growth decelerate from 96% platform growth to 80%, then 60%, then 40%, then 20% then 0%. This is very pessimistic based on historical advertising trends, and if that happens, we're still looking at $1.5B in platform revenue at the end of it. The kicker is that this revenue plays out for a while, because people take 8 years on average to replace their TV. So you are looking at an $800M annuity for 8 years(let's say 4 years, since it includes sticks + TVs), and you can see that even the worst case scenario is just not that bad. I think the likelihood of this happening, is low. Lots of downside protection here.

**Recent Quarter**

It's not any less expensive after that quarter. That quarter was a total blow-out. If you updated your DCF model, that intrinsic value got bumped up by 25%, at least. Don't fall for the fallacy that it's now more expensive.

**Competition from FAANG**

I like the notion that there is ""competition from FAANG"" because while it's never materialized in the numbers(ROKU is constantly blowing out estimates, not falling short), it makes people fearful. When theory conflicts with experience, virgins cling to theory, while Chads embrace experience. Be a Chad.",2018-08-10

9f9aja,36,48,wallstreetbets,Here Is My Strategy for Swing Trading,0.86,1536798553.0,1536769753.0,"**Trading Strategy Simplified**

o Over the last few months, I believe I have finally figured out how to swing trade stocks using fundamentals (most importantly), technicals (for entries and exits), and indicators to show me more data on that stock (remember though, price action > indicators, so let the market do the talking).

o So lets break this down, when I first started I tried using all sorts of MAs, EMAs, VWAP, Bollinger Bands, ETC. but for ME, I find that these indicators made my chart too crowded and therefore over-complicating the issue. I try to think like “big money” now. If you can imagine that in your account you were responsible for 100 million dollars, you would want to invest in “good” or fundamentally solid companies. So why think any differently about your measly robinhood account if the goal is to make money?

**Strategy**

o First and foremost, any company that I want to trade/invest in, go to their website (I really only play “good stocks)! See what the offer, see if they are a leader or an innovator, or whatever their “thing” may be, look around on the website to get a better understanding of the company and what they do.

o Second, I got to yahoo finance and just check over their fundamentals (on the sheets that I had posted previously, use that as a guide). So I want to see good y/y growth, q/q growth, increased gross revenue, good ROA/ROE/ROI, stuff like that. Information that shows that a company is financially healthy and can continue its success.

o By the way some examples of “good” companies that I invest/trade/follow are: SHOP ATVI AAXN ROKU SEND TEAM TMUS etc. Typically mid-large caps, anywhere from 20-250$ or so. I try to stay away from speculative plays, biotech, and pennies. Obviously you can make good money trading all three, but for me, it isn’t appealing.

o Third, plot out the technicals (support/resistance/mental stop/PT) so that you have a PLAN. If you make a plan, write it down, you are doing it objectively. After that, stick to the plan and don’t get emotional over the trade. Let your winners ride, cut the losers quick (2à1 ratio), and don’t over think it!

o Fourth, when plotting these technicals, I **ONLY** look at the daily charts; to me the intra-day stuff isn’t important. Most of us are busy and cant pay attention to the intra-day stuff anyways. If you want, just set alerts on your TOS or whatever app you like about a stock, and get a notification if it crosses a

certain threshold. Again, you can use different times frames, but for me this

is what works.  
o On the daily time frame, the ONLY indicators I use are 26MA (roughly a

month), 50MA (big $$ indicator), 65MA, 200MA (big $$ indicator).  
o Fifth, when looking at my chats, im trying to find “good” stocks that are either

about to breakout (ROKU AMD TEAM), and you can “see it.” The patterns are very similar, and when you couple that with good fundamentals, you have a very good chance of making good money. Here are a couple examples of what the “set up” looks like.

o Do you notice how these stocks (AMD TEAM ROKU), have all followed a nice trend up? So remember, the trend is your friend, and if you have good fundamentals on a company, you can add to an over-reaction (for example NKE and Kaepernick).

o Quick example of WHY YOU NEEEEEEEEEED fundamentals for a stock to continue moving higher. Lets look at ATVI which finally completed the Cup and Handle.

o Notice the Cup and Handle and then the breakout after, so technically speaking, that is a textbook example of a cup and handle, BUT it only happened because of NEWS with ATVI. They had an upgrade yesterday, which was the CATALYST to that technical pattern. So playing technicals ONLY can get you in trouble that is why it is extremely important to couple your technicals with FUNDAMENTALS. If you need more references, look back at other sheets I have posted, or just use Google/YouTube/etc. to understand more about technicals. The internet is a powerful tool for investors, use it!

**Key Points**

o Keep it simple.  
o Think like a whale.  
o Visit the companies website.  
o Use fundamentals as your base and technicals as your entry/exit.o Don’t solely rely on technicals, use them as a tool.

Also the actual sheet has pictures on it of examples, if you would like a copy DM me and I would be happy to provide. I have been posting other cheat sheets/materials to this sub. If you need more educational material, or material in general, reach out. You can be autistic and a good trader too. ",2018-09-12
9g0bj1,5,12,wallstreetbets,$COUP and $LMT 9/21 calls,0.88,1537033763.0,1537004963.0,"Keep an eye out for these two. Feedback appreciated.

COUP hit $84.60ish on 9/5 (from $72 on 9/4). It’s been coiling in the maximum range of $76-82 for several days ever since it hit ATH.  IMO it could make an attempt to break it this coming week. A very similar stock I’ve seen do this recently is ROKU after it hit ATH, coiled, then obliterated it’s ATH maybe a week after. I bought $80 strike 9/21 expiry @$1.20 premium at $79.20 before close. 

Another one I think is set for continuation is LMT. It was at $320 two days ago and has now climbed to 335.80. I saw resistances at low $335s which is why I didn’t take a pos. but in AH they announced a $7.2b w/ the Air Force. Could be a nice little runner next week.

Ideally would like one red day with LMT so the premiums can cool off a bit but other than that those are my two biggest plays going into next week. How retarded am I?",2018-09-14
9ijme3,32,117,StockMarket,Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days),0.95,1537836795.0,1537807995.0,"
This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are NOT excluded from this report.

9kgwd5,34,129,StockMarket,Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days),0.96,1538433627.0,1538404827.0,"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are NOT excluded from this report.

To help you YOLO your money away, here are all of the tickers mentioned in all the posts within the past 24 hours (and links to their Yahoo Finance page):

Note: this is a trial run. I plan on correcting the formatting to shrink the length down for tomorrow and will eventually add sentiment analysis ranking frustration, bullish/bearish, etc.  In addition, I’m still working on ways to weed out non-tickets (see URL in this case). It’s quite difficult when tickers are mentioned without the $.

9mn5lb,25,10,wallstreetbets,Selling Covered Calls Questions,0.78,1539099364.0,1539070564.0,"I'm trying to understand how what I'm wanting to do is a bad plan, but can't seem to see a downside. I figured I'm too much of an autistic monkey to figure it out on my own, so I'm asking you guys.

I've got 10k shares of Roku with an average price of 69.00. I want to liquidate them at 70 (if it ever gets up there again). If I wrote a covered call expiring every Friday until someone exercises it, what is the downside opposed to just setting a limit sell order and ignoring it until it sells?

I would make the premium, and if it gets exercised at 70, it would be the same as selling it normally, right?


Assuming that's correct, why wouldn't someone sell calls out to 2021 with some easy to exercise (but still at a profit) strike range, take the premium and just buy more shares at the current price and do it again and again?

I mean, that seems like free money. It has to be wrong, right? What am I missing? Worst case scenario (other than the stock drilling to the core and being worthless with no way to sell it)? ",2018-10-09

9qfhpk,2,32,StockMarket,Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days),0.91,1540254957.0,1540226157.0,"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are NOT excluded from this report.

# **Stocks fall after wild session as conflicting trade news keeps investors guessing** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/02/stock-market-triple-digit-gains-for-dow-nonfarm-payrolls.html)*
*****
> Stocks traded in a wide range on Friday as investors digested different comments and reports on global trade, while Apple shares dented the broader tech sector.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 109.91 points lower at 25,270.83 after falling 300 points earlier in the session. At its session high, it was up as much as 198.24 points. The S&P 500pulled back 0.7 percent to 2,723.06 as Apple's 6.6 percent decline dragged down other major tech names like Facebook and Alphabet. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 1 percent to end the day at 7,356.99.
*****
> The major indexes pared some of their losses after President Donald Trump told reporters the U.S. and China are much closer to striking a deal on trade, saying the two countries will have a good deal in place.
*****
> Trump's comments come after Larry Kudlow, his top economic advisor, told CNBC there is no trade plan in the works for China. ""There's no massive movement to deal with China,"" Kudlow told CNBC's ""Halftime Report. "" ""We have already put out asks to China with respect to trade.""
*****
> ""We're doing a normal, routine run-through of things that we've already put together and normal preparation,"" he said. ""We're not on the cusp of a deal."" When asked whether the president explicitly requested his top advisors to drum up a trade deal, Kudlow said ""no."" Kudlow's comments sent equities to their lows of the day.
*****
> Meanwhile, Kudlow's remarks contradicted a Bloomberg report from earlier on Friday that said Trump had asked officials to prepare a draft for a U.S.-China trade deal.
*****
> ""It's still all about trade,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. ""Most of the trading we're seeing is related to earnings or trade.""
*****
> ""The recent moves we're seeing are reflect a return to more historical levels of volatility,"" said Kinahan. ""I don't think this will abate.""
*****
> Apple fell after the company's iPhone shipments for last quarter missed estimates. The company also offered light guidance and announced major changes to its reporting structure. These were enough to overshadow stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue.
*****
> Stocks initially surged after the Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 250,000 jobs last month. Economists polled by Refinitiv expected an addition of 190,000. Wages, meanwhile, rose 3.1 percent on an annualized basis in October for the first time since the recession.
*****
> ""Today's stronger than expected October employment report was a mixed bag for stocks,"" said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell. ""On the positive side, strong job growth will allay fears of slowing economic growth. However, with wages up 3.1 percent year over year … it will be more difficult for the Fed to slow its rate hiking campaign.""
*****
> Investors are worried that rising wages and increasing inflationary pressures will push the Federal Reserve to raise rates at a faster pace than expected. The central bank has hiked rates three times this year and is forecast to raise them once more before year-end.
*****
> ""There's good news for everyone in this report, but it also makes it clear that the economy is running a little bit faster than we can probably sustain,"" said Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark. ""The Fed must, and is trying to, slow down the economy"" so growth remains sustainable.
*****
> Treasury yields rose following the data's release. The benchmark 10-year note yield traded around 3.21 percent while the two-year yield climbed to 2.91 percent and hit its highest level in a decade.

# Good Riddance, October

> Well, it’s a good thing that October is over. In the end, the S&P 500 Index lost 6.9%, for the worst month since September 2011.

> Here are some of the highlights—or lowlights—from the month:

> * Besides being the worst month for the S&P 500 in seven years, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 5.1% for its worst month since January 2016, while the Nasdaq’s -9.2% return marked its worst month since November 2008. The big loser was small caps though, as the Russell 2000 Index fell 10.9%, its worst month since September 2011.

> * The six-month win streak for the S&P 500 is officially over. Want some good news? Since 1990, it has had 10 other 6-month win streaks, and the index was higher every single time 12 months later, up 13.6% on average.

> * The S&P 500 fell 16 days during the month, tying the most down days for any one month since October 2008.

> * The first back-to-back up days for the S&P 500 took place on the final two trading days of the month, with the index gaining more than 1% each day. This occurred nearly right on cue, as the end of the month tends to see the best moves.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/stocks-tend-to-bounce-the-last-part-of-october.png?ssl=1))**

> * In fact, the S&P 500 had gone 28 consecutive trading days without back-to-back up days. As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, that tied the longest streak going back to the Great Depression. That sums up how persistent the selling has been recently.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/this-tied-the-longest-streak-without-back-to-back-up-days-since-the-great-depression.png?ssl=1))**

> * After not a single 1% move up or down during the entire third quarter, the S&P 500 saw 10 changes of at least 1% up or down last month. That was the most for any month since 12 changes back in February 2018. October even had four changes of at least 2%, for the most since January 2016.

> * Lastly, turning to the Dow, in terms of the cumulative intraday range for the Dow during October, it moved a total of 9,872 points. Only February 2018 and October 2008 had larger movements.

> “October was a rough ride, and most investors are likely quite happy to wave it goodbye. The good news remains that valuations are the lowest they’ve been in years, earnings continue to surprise to the upside, and November and December during a midterm year are historically quite strong,” summarized LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gains-during-a-midterm-year-tended-to-happen-late.png?ssl=1))**

*****

# A Silver Lining

> It’s been a rocky ride so far in October, but there is a silver lining. “Incredibly, the S&P 500 during a midterm year has never finished lower if you bought the October low and held till the end of the year,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> Of course, no one can pick a market low with any consistency, but with October about to end, it is safe to assume the low happened last week or will happen over the next few days.

> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the past 18 midterm years saw the S&P 500 Index gain from the October lowest close until the end of the year every single time—up 10.6% on average. Given the average year since 1950 is up 7.4% on average from the October lows, midterm years can see even more strength to end the year.

# November Kicks Off the “Best Months”

> November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. The month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.

> November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-three DJIA (since 1950) and NASDAQ (since 1971) month. November is second best for S&P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 2000 (since 1979). November is the Russell 1000’s best month (since 1979).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ecf3f65936f368406442f83e6867c3cd/tumblr_inline_ph7z8tWpgo1spdppr_400.jpg))**

> In midterm years, November’s market prowess is relatively unchanged. DJIA has advanced in 13 of the last 17 midterm years since 1950 with an average gain of 2.5%. S&P 500 has also been up in 13 of the past 17 midterm years, gaining on average 2.6%. Small-caps perform well with Russell 2000 climbing in 6 of the past 9 midterm years, averaging 3.5%. The only real blemish in the November midterm-year record is 1974 (DJIA –7.0%, bear market ended in December).

# Best and Worst Performing S&P 500 Stocks on Earnings

> Below is a list of the best performing S&P 500 stocks on their earnings reaction days so far this season. Under Armour (UAA) ranks at the very top of the list with a huge one-day gain of 27.71% after it reported a triple play on October 30th. (A triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises guidance.)

> Vulcan Materials (VMC) ranks second with a gain of 17.49%, followed by Akamai Tech (AKAM), Newfield Exploration (NFX), and Twitter (TWTR). Other notables on the list of big winners this earnings season include International Paper (IP), Ford (F), PayPal (PYPL), Church & Dwight (CHD), Starbucks (SBUX), General Motors (GM), Procter & Gamble (PG), DowDuPont (DWDP), and Whirlpool (WHR). These certainly aren’t your typical high-fliers!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/beststocksonearnings.png))**

> On the downside, Mohawk (MHK) has been the worst performer this earnings season with a one-day decline of 23.86% after it reported a reverse triple play on October 25th. The stock missed EPS estimates, missed revenue estimates, and lowered guidance.

> Align Tech (ALGN) ranks second worst with a one-day decline of 20.2%, followed by Western Digital (WDC), Advanced Micro (AMD), and United Rentals (URI). Other notables on the list of losers include Equifax (EFX), Fortinet (not to be confused with the video game Fortnite!), Fortune Brands (FBHS), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Kellogg (K), General Electric (GE), AT&T (T), and Amazon (AMZN).

# The Jekyll and Hyde Earnings Season

> In the early part of the current earnings reporting period that began back on October 12th, stocks couldn’t sniff a bid on their earnings reaction days. Since Monday, however, investors have been busy buying up stocks after they report.

> Below we show how stocks within sectors performed on their earnings reaction days from the start of earnings season through the morning of October 29th. We also show how stocks have performed on their earnings reaction days since the close on the 29th. As shown, for all stocks that have reported, the average stock fell 0.91% on its earnings reaction day through October 29th. Since then, the average stock that has reported has gained 1.56% on its earnings reaction day. That’s a huge shift in sentiment around earnings reports. Investors have flipped from selling the news to buying the news.

> There have been some interesting trends within sectors as well. Health Care, Materials, Energy, Technology, Consumer Staples, and Industrials stocks that reported got hit the hardest prior to the 29th. Since then, the cyclical sectors of this group (all of them except for Consumer Staples) have seen stocks fly higher by 1.3% or more on their earnings reaction days, while Consumer Staples stocks that have reported since the 29th have actually declined. Utilities and Communication Services stocks have averaged very small declines on their earnings reaction days over both time frames. Finally, Consumer Discretionary stocks have been a positive outlier throughout earnings season. Discretionary stocks that reported prior to the 29th bucked the trend and averaged gains on their earnings reaction days. And since the 29th, they’ve continued to see gains, averaging a one-day change of +2.1%.

Roku is becoming a powerhouse in streaming media and still developing their platform. This includes bring other streaming content providers into their platform. As such their earnings are still red due to high tech development costs.

I think the current reaction is overblown and Roku is now a great bargain. They have over 10% short interest right now and that is probably growing. If they increase their revs with increased ad and content sharing from the expected in platform expansion we could see some explosive growth by 2020.",2018-11-08

9vb8wo,13,11,Daytrading,+$499 Day Trading Review. 8 Nov 18,1.0,1541721875.0,1541693075.0,"Help me learn! Maybe help others learn! If feedback is positive, im going to try to do this everyday.

I learned based from Andrew Aziz's chatroom and books. I like his style and it does OK for me. I work a day job and only have 30 minutes to an hour to trade per day. The idea is to get in, make some money and get out. Staying in the market brings additional risk that i can't afford.

I started with a $30K account, dropped to a $26K and then made it back up to around $29K before making a really bad trade losing $3K. That knocked me down and ive been struggling to get back up. Since then ive been mostly doing simulator trading trying to find my groove again. Watch my other youtube trades to see how poorly its been recently.

&#x200B;

So here is my day for 8 Nov. Let me know what you see. I would love input on how to get better.

Started my day looking over gapper stocks and creating a watchlist. Then had to get my son ready for day care and came back to my computer at 0934. In the video you can hear Andrew talking about his trades. Ive found i get FOMO if i listen to him and dont think about my own trades so i muted him after a few minutes.

I quickly looked through my watchlist and settled on ROKU. Strategy was a 5 minute opening range breakout. The one minute looked like it dropped then bounced back a bit to VWAP (blue line) and the 9 EMA before trending down slightly. I went short 250 shares and followed with another 500 shares when it made a new 1 minute low. Stop was a new 1 minute high around $51. After that i covered in quarters of my position starting at the daily low and then phasing out as it dropped. I planned on exiting fully if it made a new 1 minute high. I had a support level from the daily chart drawn at about $48.8 that i thought it was going to bounce off and i only had 58 shares level so i exited the rest of the position.

Things to think about. ROKU was on a short selling restriction and DAS doesn't do a good job with that in the sim. There would have been a good chance that i didn't get my position filled right when i went short.

I could have also stayed in the position and then added more at the pull back to VWAP around 0953 but I had made my money by then and didn't want to risk what I already had. Greed is what killed my account in the first place.

Feel free to add suggestions. These are just suggesstions, Id recomended doing some hw before making a decision. Personally I am just setting long expiration puts, so I can just play the trend without the pressure of Theta. (Also excluding a lot of biotech, but if somone has a good one I could add it).

adm297,21,121,StockMarket,Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days),0.98,1546922991.0,1546894191.0,"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely last week in the market, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 18th, 2019.

# **What to watch in the market in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/15/fed-could-be-back-in-play-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The Fed calmed the markets in late January when it said it could stop raising interest rates, but investors are watching the release of its meeting minutes for any sign the Fed could veer off its easy path.
*****
> ""It's hard to imagine the Fed sounding as dovish in the minutes, as [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell sounded in the briefing . We do think the minutes will be bearish. As far as the general tenor, it's hard to see it more dovish than it was on Jan. 30,"" said Michael Schumacher, director strategy at Wells Fargo.
*****
> The Fed, at that meeting, held rates steady and emphasized it could pause in its rate hiking cycle. In what felt like an about face from its December meeting, Powell also emphasized that the Fed would be flexible with its balance sheet. The Fed releases the minutes of its meeting Wednesday afternoon.
*****
> Positive comments on trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials, and a commitment to continue talks in the coming week helped boost stocks Friday and could continue to support the market in the week ahead. Investors were also watching for more information on a Commerce Department report, which could be viewed as a market negative if it recommended tariffs on European automobiles. The president has 90 days from this weekend to act on the report.
*****
> Stocks were higher in the past week, even with Thursday's sell off on stunningly weak December retail sales data. The S&P 500 was up 2.5 percent to 2,775, and the Dow was at 25,883, up 3 percent for the week.
*****
> After December retail sales slumped 1.7 percent, Walmart earnings on Tuesday will be even more important. The retail sales data was contrary to other reports from retailers and others that showed solid holiday sales, so Walmart's comments about what it is seeing now as well as during the end of the fourth quarter will be important.
*****
> ""We're going to watch them very closely, and that's because of the retail sales number. The government shutdown, plus the market going down, everyone talking about a recession coming. Did people cut back spending a little bit? Was it real?"" said Vinay Pande, head of trading strategies at UBS Global Wealth Management.
*****
> Walmart's comparable store sales in the fourth quarter were expected to be up about 3 percent, and its earnings per share are expected to be flat at $1.33, according to FactSet.
*****
> Economists cut their expectations for fourth quarter growth to under 2.5 percent after the retail sales number, which was viewed as suspect by some. Goldman Sachs economists called the report an outlier, and said that as much of 1 percentage point of the drop is unexplained.
*****
> ""Some special factors likely contributed to the fall in core retail sales, including an early Thanksgiving, the December stock-market sell-off, and the start of the government shutdown,"" it said.
*****
> So the coming week's data will also be important, including weekly jobless claims Thursday, which were higher for a third week this past week. The concern is that rising claims could be an early warning sign of a slowdown in the labor market.
*****
> ""Unemployment claims are rising, at the same time employment growth and income growth are not suggesting this is the case,"" said Pande.
*****
> Data on home builder sentiment comes out Tuesday morning, and existing home sales and unemployment claims Thursday.
*****
> Pande said the market broke out in the past week from a sideways trade it fell into earlier in the month. ""Until last week, we just went back to the status quo of November,"" he said, adding the sell off in December was way overdone. The market has been at an impasse between the lift from value, and the drag from what he called the idiosyncratic risks, like trade, the shutdown threat and other geopolitical risk.
*****
> ""I think the balance shifted a bit. The bad news on the idiosyncratic front is being overwhelmed by the less bad,"" Pande said.
*****
> Pande said there's a risk that investors will read the Fed's minutes in the coming week a little more hawkish than it intends.
*****
> There could be discussion in the minutes about the balance sheet unwind, which some traders fear has been making markets less liquid.
*****
> At the Jan. 30 meeting and before, Powell had backtracked on a comment he made after the December meeting that the unwind was on ""autopilot.""
*****
> ""It's not a gigantic concession to say I'm flexible. This QT was going to end at any rate at the end of the year,"" said Pande, adding ""we could misinterpret the minutes.""
*****
> Schumacher said the bond market will be looking for details on which securities the Fed might be rolling off of its balance sheet and which it will be replacing with new purchases, as their holdings mature.
*****
> ""We think potentially the biggest move in the bond market as far as the minutes go is the composition of the balance sheet. It's not so much the equilibrium number, or when the Fed gets there...There's been talk that the Fed should shorten the duration of its Treasurys. That should mean a steeper curve and higher long term yields,"" Schumacher said. If the Fed does signal it wants to hold shorter-duration securities, yields on the 10-year and 30-year bond could rise.

# Day After Presidents’ Day: Improving, But Record Still Bearish

> Yesterday we pointed out the day before Presidents’ Day was amongst the poorest performing holiday over the long run. The day after is even weaker over the long run. However since 2012, the market’s performance after the long holiday weekend has improved, most notably during the last seven years with S&P 500 positive in six of these years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e0bc132e22ecfc6c5fcb0159f30e9a65/tumblr_inline_pmzeooZGoE1spdppr_500.jpg))**

# Should Investors Love A Great Start to 2019?

> Happy Valentine’s Day everyone! With the S&P 500 Index up 9.8% for the year as of yesterday, this is its best start up to this point since 1991. So should investors love to see this much green this early in the year, or should they be leery they might be heartbroken down the road?

> An old adage on Wall Street suggests, “As goes January, so goes the year.” With stocks having posted their best January in more than 30 years, it’s time to take a closer look at the January barometer, first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader’s Almanac. Simply put, if the first month of the year is green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa).

> Let’s get one thing straight—this didn’t work last year. The S&P 500 was up more than 5% in January of 2018, and it closed the year in the red. Nonetheless, the January barometer has a strong track record, and one we shouldn’t ignore.

> As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&P 500 has been green in January, the rest of the year (final 11 months) has been up 11.7% on average, well above the overall average return of 7.6% for the final 11 months of the year. However, when that first month was red, the final 11 months were up only 1.2% on average. According to LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, “The January barometer isn’t perfect, but it does have a pretty solid track record. Now where things really get interesting is when that first month was up more than 7% (like in 2019), the return over the final 11 months actually became stronger.” 

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/the-january-barometer-has-bulls-smiling.png?ssl=1))**

> Of course, we don’t suggest investing based simply on what the first month does, but with a more accommodative Federal Reserve, fiscal policy still flowing, and likely continued better-than-expected corporate earnings growth, this is yet another sign that 2019 may see a continuation of the bull market, as we outlined previously in our Outlook 2019.

> In all the instances when the S&P 500 was up more than 7% at the end of January, the rest of the year gained five out of six times, with only 1987 negative. Still, a 10.3% return over the final 11 months implies we’d see new highs before 2019 is over. Last, be open to a pullback, as a median correction of 8.1% has happened in the past after super strong starts to the year.

# The Year of the Pig Could Have Bulls Smiling

> “Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.

> The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) kicked off Tuesday, February 5, and with it came the Year of the Pig. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs—it is important to note that the Year of the Pig has historically been quite strong for equities.

> Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&P 500 Index starting in late January dating all the way back to 1928.* And wouldn’t you know it? The Year of the Pig is up nearly 15% on average. Oink oink indeed!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Year-of-the-Pig-Returns-are-quite-strong.png?ssl=1))**

> “The year of the pig is the twelfth of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the pig is considered a symbol of wealth in Chinese culture, which is quite interesting given some strong equity returns have taken place during this year. In fact, out of the 12 zodiac signs, no year sports a better average return,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Year-of-the-Pig-Could-have-Bulls-Happy-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Be aware that a small sample size and the pure randomness of this makes us want to stress not to ever invest purely based on the zodiac signs. Still, here’s to the year of the pig playing out for the bulls once again!

* U.S. stock futures were pointing to a mostly lower open on Wall Street this morning after the Nasdaq logged its seventh straight session of gains. The S&P 500 advanced in six of the last seven sessions. The Dow was up four in the last five sessions. (CNBC)
* U.S.-China trade talks continue in Washington today, with President Donald Trump signaling flexibility on the March tariff cease-fire deadline. Chinese state media warned that new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would be ""catastrophic"" for global stocks. (CNBC)
* Investors get more insight into the Fed's thinking on the economy and interest rates, when the minutes from its January meeting are out at 2 p.m. ET. * Meanwhile, weekly mortgage applications rose 3.6 percent, a sign of hope for the spring home buying season. (CNBC)
* CVS Health (CVS) shares were sinking after the pharmacy giant reported better-than-expected earnings but missed estimates on revenue. CVS also warned on full-year earnings. CVS closed its $70 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna in November. (CNBC)

* The Trump administration wants California to pay back billions of dollars for the bullet train. California said the move was in response to the state suing the administration over the president's emergency declaration to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. (AP)

* Goldman Sachs downgrades Southwest because new Hawaii route could be too costly (CNBC)
* Payless ShoeSource, which filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, hopes to keep its 2,500 U.S. stores open until at least the end of March and the majority until May. The liquidation will not impact its franchised or Latin American stores. (CNBC)
* Microsoft (MSFT) said hackers targeted European think tanks and non-profit organizations, which often have contact with government officials. The attacks were carried out late last year through phishing campaigns to steal employee credentials and deliver malware. (CNBC)
* Germany is not ready to exclude Huawei from its 5G network, a blow to U.S. efforts to persuade allies to ban the Chinese tech firm. In December, Canada arrested Huawei's CFO at the request of the U.S., which alleged bank and wire fraud in violation of American sanctions against Iran. (CNBC)
* UK defense think tank warns that allowing Huawei into 5G network is 'irresponsible' (CNBC)

* U.S.-China trade talks continue in Washington today, with President Donald Trump signaling flexibility on the March tariff cease-fire deadline. Chinese state media warned that new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would be ""catastrophic"" for global stocks. (CNBC)
* Investors get more insight into the Fed's thinking on the economy and interest rates, when the minutes from its January meeting are out at 2 p.m. ET. * Meanwhile, weekly mortgage applications rose 3.6 percent, a sign of hope for the spring home buying season. (CNBC)

* The Trump administration wants California to pay back billions of dollars for the bullet train. California said the move was in response to the state suing the administration over the president's emergency declaration to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. (AP)

* Payless ShoeSource, which filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, hopes to keep its 2,500 U.S. stores open until at least the end of March and the majority until May. The liquidation will not impact its franchised or Latin American stores. (CNBC)
* Microsoft (MSFT) said hackers targeted European think tanks and non-profit organizations, which often have contact with government officials. The attacks were carried out late last year through phishing campaigns to steal employee credentials and deliver malware. (CNBC)
* Germany is not ready to exclude Huawei from its 5G network, a blow to U.S. efforts to persuade allies to ban the Chinese tech firm. In December, Canada arrested Huawei's CFO at the request of the U.S., which alleged bank and wire fraud in violation of American sanctions against Iran. (CNBC)
* UK defense think tank warns that allowing Huawei into 5G network is 'irresponsible' (CNBC)

aunrfv,13,99,StockMarket,Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days),0.94,1551144490.0,1551115690.0,"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

Maybe it's time we start getting on the other side of our shitty trades. Anyone here have any successful Buy-write or Cash secured Put writing strategies? Any good stocks for this right now? 

I've been writing calls against ROKU. Huge IV right now. Been having some good success, but I think it might be time to start writing cash secured puts at a price I wouldn't mind buying too.

For example on the ROKU trade. You could buy 100 shares and sell the $100 January Call for \~$8.  You could use this $8 to buy 10 more shares in case ROKU takes off big in the next 9 months. Or just collect the premium. Or buy a Put for downside protection to make a collar.  

Alternatively, you could sell the January $50 Put for \~$5.50. You would put up \~$4500 for the cash secured put. If never called away, you would make around 12% on that trade over 9 months. ",2019-03-08

* Image sharing website Pinterest said this morning it would offer 75 million of its Class A shares as part of its initial public offer and priced them in the range of $15 to $17 per share. The company plans to list under the symbol ""PINS"" on the NYSE. (Reuters)

They know infinitely more than I do, and  has way more experience. I can totally be wrong about virtually everything, so if anything inverse everything I say. Actually don't do that, in case I'm accidentally correct. Believe me, my username checks out.

**Don't do anything based on what I say. I'm serious. Please Don't.**

I plan on developing the application (unless one of you guys want to do it, Not like I give a fuck.) after I finish up my finals and stuff. This is a pretty decent replacement in the meantime.

Okay So let's do this.

# Current State of Markets

To be honest, there are only a few things that i think \_ really \_ matters right now.

So, firstly, the S&P 500 has reached it all time highest  of $2,933.68. Same goes for the NASDAQ Index.

The US is currently attempting to stop all countries from purchasing oil from Iran- with China being the only one that's still doing so. The deal was set a while back and countries had been given an amount of time to determine an alternative.

We are currently in Earnings Season's and the defense sector has won out quite a bit. The health sector is being influenced by our hopeful socialist candidate. $UNH was a fantastic play these last few days.

This is not important, but it proves you guys suck: $SNAP beat ER. So yeah.

# Technical Analysis and Stock Picks

**$SPY- (Bullish Uptrend)** 

So obviously it's returning back to it's previous highs and intends on holding above it. The volume didn't break even the average, so I not very confident in it. It hasn't consolidated yet, so there is a potential for tomorrow to be a red day (not 100% on this). Since $SPY is riding the 6 and 12 day EMAs, it's pretty solid trend. The lack of consolidation and the fact that the RSI has crossed into overbought (keep in mind, stocks and ETFs are capable of continuing above 70% for a while- but we usually see a pullback. So its possible to expect that tomorrow.

This isn't any particular pattern as far as I am aware, but I've definitely seen this happen a few times with stocks before and it acts as an ascending wedge. **It could fall back.** 

https://preview.redd.it/sxvdnm0as4u21.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=31cc007d2a045e4f7b4d4d393414c5336bdf28d6

**$AAPL- (Bullish)** 

I called the bull run on Apple around March 20th and i still see it happening.

Apple has ER in about a week, and a shit ton of ground to cover. Many stocks have to recover back before the Q4 bear run. Including $AMZN and this boi. This stock definitely feels like it can potentially rise back to around $230, If the ER is solid it'll probably be the catalyst that we need push up past the $210 resistance.

https://preview.redd.it/suesyhqjv4u21.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=952a94f115ff12b5d02a5e04f7aeae17fe59360f

The cross on the RSI, isn't necessarily the cause for concern, but we should anticipate that we'll lose some momentum which is why you don't **BUY FDs ON SWINGS.**

I swung this for a few days and made a decent percentage with minimal downside. It works (mostly). I'll probably get in and out through the rest of the week.

**UNH- Bullish**

This stock is a paint point for me because I was in a Puts play in it when it was about $1.50. I pussied out and watched this bastard climb it's way to $11.00. But its a good play. It's recovering from a major market over reaction to the ER and the Bernie Sanders Medicare-for-all.

I really like the options on this stock and they are powerful on solid moves.

https://preview.redd.it/zhplvkalx4u21.png?width=551&format=png&auto=webp&s=76ef2d66d3098043e21eb021b1ebc51c4034d1c8

The DMI+ is pushing upward while the - is downward with a stronger ADX. With the MACD is also recovering. And the Weekly bottom candle is (kind of) a Doji. With this week being a confirmation- thus far.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tz5gsf1205u21.png?width=201&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ca919adf49cd162b2038e64202bb6dbee9a4630

I'd wait for it to break 232. It may try to fill a gap up to 234, which isnt that big, but gives it an official bull trend which is a good thing for calls as it'll break the 12 day EMA.

&#x200B;

**Amazon (AMZN)- Bullish** 

I definitely think I could confidently $LONG this stock up to 2000. It's just how $AMZN moves sometimes. May see some resistance around 1967. And probably 1950 since that's just how it does things.

Not going to bother with a chart here.

I am concerned though, because I've been seeing a bearish divergence so It may reverese sometime soon, pretty strongly.

&#x200B;

**Boeing (BA) -sidways until it crosses 384**

Their ER is tomorrow morning. So basically I anticipate that they won't be down on revenue because the MAX 8 weren't discontinued till the end of the quarter. HOWEVER, we will definitely see them lowering their guidance for obvious reasons.

So the open gap from a bit ago has some room to fill. We have a support level at $363.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v5ayc3y125u21.png?width=1321&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b9e6e006a922d4dfcac4172d3ca91cdefd37231

If the ER has a bullish sentiment behind it- then you can anticipate a large move. Probably to 378 or 380, depending on the open.

Volume Drop-off is because of ER so expect some interesting volatility tomorrow. (I can't really speak to how much, yet)

&#x200B;

# I'm tired as fuck and have other shit to do now, so I'll just post the rest of my notes and update this later.

&#x200B;

**ROKU**

on the weekly is a double top, reaching its bottom, as well as on the daily a major break through a major support .

&#x200B;

**JNJ**

Good guidance in ER but a strong 140 resistance. (this note is from quite a bit ago.)

&#x200B;

**QCOM**

(also from about a week ago after the lawsuit ended)

Insane Move, Outlook on this should be put side

(STRONG) 76.5 Level, Most recent Highest High, High Vol Break Down for Trade

(IDK) 81.23 Level, Got it in the last 5 Years, Was previous High at that Time, Pre-market seems to hit that Level

(IDK) 78.38 Level, Bottom of that range from this level to 81.23, could act as ""support""

&#x200B;

# Final Notes:

I did notice that most if not all of my plays are $LONG. This is either because I'm wrong, or the market it bullish, idiot. But seriously, some of these have intraday shorts that you'll want be on the look out for if you scalp at all. Otherwise, wait for confirmation.

&#x200B;

Some of these plays can be weighted by the whole market or sector depending on how everything goes. If you see $SPY jump up $10 or some bullshit like that, expect the same for most of the tech stocks. We're at a very interesting point in the market in my opinion and at this point it's anyone's game. We could continue to rally or all of the newbies entering the market will get mega-fucked and time will tell.

&#x200B;

I haven't entirely determined how I'll format these, but i will probably try to keep it up because if I don't I'll have an autistic fit and just buy a bunch of Macy's calls.",2019-04-23
bh8uqg,8,10,wallstreetbets,"Technical Analysis and Stock Picks [April 25, 2019]",0.79,1556228967.0,1556200167.0,"I didn't expect this but I feel like I learned a lot from writing up everything (not everything). Also, I'm not exactly sure how I want to format these yet or how often I'm going to update them, but I'll figure it out eventually.

I actually meant to post this last night, but I wasn't finished so I got up an wrote the rest this morning.

&#x200B;

I'm definitely going to need to put this disclaimer for the rest of eternity so that I don't get murdered by angry internet gamblers.

&#x200B;

""**Don't do anything based on what I say. I'm serious. Please Don't.**

This  only exists because I can't find a decent trading journal. Especially  one that would remind me to check whether or not I was right. I plan on  developing the application (unless one of you guys want to do it, Not  like I give a fuck.) after I finish up my finals and stuff. This is a  pretty decent replacement in the meantime.""

&#x200B;

Also here's something interesting I've known about for a while but i think writing it out can put it in perspective. If you can hold an option longer (without being a dumbass bag-holder) you stand to make significantly more than you do if you buy FDs all fucking day. Crazy advice for gamblers but hey, chase the win or some bullshit like that.

Basically, you can buy some options that have a further expiration- if you can manage to get them for cheap on whatever trend you've decided on, and over time you can reap those sweet %s that you morons jump for intraday.

I've watched options move hundreds of percentages over a longer trend- even if it's wrong sometimes. But it doesn't do that for FDs.

&#x200B;

There's also advice that I'd taken from several books, which is to not jump on to a moving train. For a proper trade, you want to be ready before the stock explodes- and sure, you can't predict that, but that's not your job. Your job is to figure out what the market is telling you, and reacting appropriately. Or maybe your job is to blow all of your wife's vacation money. I don't judge.

Okay, I'm done being a wet blanket.

# Let's recap:

So firstly, today was an absolute clusterfuck. Tesla (TSLA) missed eps by 336% and is so far not reacting. Boeing (BA) weeklies moved 100% twice during and then down following their investors call. And Facebook (FB) broke out like a motherfucker AH. And Amazon dropped down all day, and then mostly recovered AH.

&#x200B;

*Okay, another thing. I'm sure I don't have to explain that I'm not necessarily predicting the next day's behaviour rather the trend of the market for a particular amount of time.*

&#x200B;

Okay, so I'll go through some of yesterdays callouts.

&#x200B;

**SPY**

So this is kind of what I expected.

>The lack of consolidation and the fact that the RSI has crossed into  overbought (keep in mind, stocks and ETFs are capable of continuing  above 70% for a while- but we usually see a pullback. So its possible to  expect that tomorrow.

I also said:

>This isn't any particular pattern as far as I am aware, but I've  definitely seen this happen a few times with stocks before and it acts  as an ascending wedge. **It could fall back.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vs2kr0t70fu21.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=63b45adcf8ee49d31fa5e8c9fce46c44aaae4da3

And as a result, we saw the RSI begin to comeback down and may continue til its made distance from the overbought territory. Whether this is a pullback or a reversal, I can't say. But at least as of right now, I'm doubtful this is a reversal.

&#x200B;

The same applies to **Amazon** but also for a completely different reason:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9r0tyk290fu21.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0fff4dd460d88896be6444c8b50e657969bf843

&#x200B;

Though Amazon didn't react this way correlative to SPY, it has been known to be influenced on the downside of its movements.

The reason is because they fully withdrew from china.

That said, I could still see AMZN going up to 2000.

But tbh its pretty easy to trade Amazon. If it picks a direction. Boom go in that direction. Easy money.

&#x200B;

**Apple (AAPL)** also did the same thing, but this time it was correlative.

https://preview.redd.it/tzti2uca0fu21.png?width=1660&format=png&auto=webp&s=c227d30246899b72b8b1d0d95e34426fe35c6638

&#x200B;

It was hella reactive, but correlative. I'm still sure that the stock will try to climb back, but that also depends on whether the market will maintain the ATH trading range.

&#x200B;

Okay, on to the new stuff.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**CATERPILLAR (CAT):**

So this bastard is sporting either an ascending wedge or a triangle (probably a triangle).

They're down yesterday because of their earnings, though they beat EPS: ( 2.94 vs 2.84 exp).

You can probably ride this stock up a bit longer, before you get an actually good upward jump, if it does end up being a wedge (which it might be based on the highs)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v0cpt15c0fu21.png?width=1634&format=png&auto=webp&s=c193022b2307aa73f01f6f79d8724f24d2356745

&#x200B;

**Facebook (FB):**

So yesterday in the afterhours as most of you know, Facebook shot up about 15 dollars. And it's actually filling a gap that it had made back last July. I'm pretty sure most of it has been covered in the afterhours, but gapping can sometimes take away any legs it has. The grey area is the gap.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ta7mz88d0fu21.png?width=1635&format=png&auto=webp&s=a75e75c209bf28fe5fff4b3ceecc03f6b22d9b81

Fundamentally there's alot about facebook that  we can talk about but I dont wanna. Moving on

&#x200B;

**AMD**:

I'm pissed about AMD because I had it front of my face all day yesterday and instead I trading Boeing. Anyway, it's now trading around $28.46. There's a bit of resistance around here thats being kinda rejected on the hourly. Youll probably find a good move here if you can get a larger volume pick up.

But, I think this may be forming a cup and handle.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y2soudce0fu21.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca0b5b4c6e0bc4e50b735861986a7accb49bde6

It hasnt really gotten to the handle part so who knows, but if it holds this area at all I could see it wedging down and then breaking out.

If it breaks 30 with solid volume, then you may have a good long play.

&#x200B;

**ROKU: Sideways (?)**

Kinda the same thing. Its got a cup and handle-ish thing going on- but thats more on the hourly chart. On the weekly and daily you have a wedge thing going on. Either way, it'll probably shoot up at one point soon. Or not.

&#x200B;

# Final Notes:

I haven't elaborated on any of the technical indicators because there's no point unless there's price action to confirm it. Remember that indicators are lagging, so by the time you find out, it may have already happened- that type of bullshit. Also volume. Volume is important. You're gonna be making shitty breakouts if the volume is below average, so watch that as well.

&#x200B;

I'm also aware that I'm not making a huge quantity of callouts, but I guess consider my previous ones active until I change it. But I will try to start getting more up.

&#x200B;

I'm not really getting to much into the volatility of the options or the stock right now because I'm just calling plays based on set up and writing this shit down takes forever. Writing the fundamentals and all that other shit will take a lot longer.

I may not play all or any of these, and you almost certainly shouldn't play any of them, but here are the shitty plays I'm unfortunately thinking of making right now for some short term, degenerate, get rich quick fuckery: 

$EA 

I think u/SoRefreshing nailed it with this one, and as such I'm following our hero in. 

Looking at playing various 105-115 5/10 Calls, and 120-135 June and July exp. Might go for some cheap 140-150 strikes as well, depending on how touched by God I'm feeling. Like most plays, I'm sure this one can't possibly go tits up. 

$WYNN 

So, for starters, I know fuck all about this company and how it is run, but I suspect a lot is not being priced in due to the shitty publicity around it. They got to keep their MA gaming licenses last night and the stock is having a nice day today. If this momentum carries into ER and earnings surprise I can see a pretty big move happening based on the chart. 

Looking at getting absolutely fucked by some 6/21 calls, probably 165-180 strikes. 

$ROKU 

First of all, fuck roku. I havent known anyone who owns one since 2010. This company basically doesn't exist for all I know, I've never even seen an ad for this shit.  With competition from the likes of Amazon and Apple, I just dont understand how they cant not lose market share from here on out. Mainly though, it's running up into earnings and that offends me. 

Looking at getting plowed by some 5/10 55 puts. Maybe some 5/31 45 puts if I'm feeling extra retarded. 

$GE 

Hell yeah, baby. This stock fucking sucks, but I think its overdone and sentiment *seems* to be turning around in the short term. I think the movement from this ER should carry forward into the next, provided the market doesn't shit itself. 

I'm seriously considering losing money on various calls, 11.5-12.5 strikes, July and August exp.

&#x200B;

Recap: (I was right about everything but NVDA, although NVDA did bounce hard and then dipped back down. It's trading in a channel between 181 and 184: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bi4j18/my\_picks\_for\_week\_of\_429/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bi4j18/my_picks_for_week_of_429/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x))

1. MCD. I kind of think it will try for 200 again.... but there's a good possibility that will trade sideways in a channel: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZwVmnA5b/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZwVmnA5b/) .     I was right about it mooning yesterday (Friday): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk04nw/what\_are\_your\_moves\_tomorrow\_may\_03/emdb449?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk04nw/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_may_03/emdb449?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) .   To get back into calls, see if MCD dips to 196.## on Monday and then get into 5/31 202.50calls for less than 1.00. If you followed my play, those 202.50c 5/31's went from 0.55 to 1.00, so almost doubled yesterday. Anyway, keep an eye on MCD and BTFD.... if there's even a dip from now to 200. :(
2. IWM: in this bull market IWM was destined to break 160 (like I said last week; see link above). It closed above 160 on Friday at 160.53. Last year, on 5/17/2018, IWM finally broke 160, and then flew to 163. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/N4eMRFvD/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/N4eMRFvD/) I think there is a very high probability that IWM is going to 163 very soon, possibly by Friday. If ETSY beats on Wednesday (and ETSY is the largest holding in IWM, btw), IWM will likely go to 163 on Thursday. Once it hits 163, it will likely cool off and consolidate back to 161.## before it makes its next leg up to 164.38ish. After that the next key resistance level is 166.69: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/pbOtleNn/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pbOtleNn/) This is based off of 2018, the only other time IWM has been in 160+ territory. I think these resistance numbers will work again, since the ALGO's bots will trade off of the 2018 data anyways. **The play: on whatever dip Monday provides, 5/25 165c for ideally slightly less than 0.60, but 0.60 would be a fine price. Could put a limit order in for 0.59 and see if it gets filled on Monday (but it may not), esp. if we open with a gap up on Monday.**                    IWM is looking SUPER bullish to me! Look at this YUGE fucking daily candle breaking out of upper BB band: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/zmCmUN3N/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zmCmUN3N/) Solid volume. This thing is gonna fly, imo.
3. SPY 5/17 300c for ideally 0.30. I plan on picking up 10 of these and will sell when SPY hits 296ish.
4. NVDA: I am convinced that NVDA will find it's way back to 191 by ER, which is on 5/16. I might be wrong, of course. Last ER, NVDA wanted to get to 160 no matter what before ER and it did. NVDA is probably manipulated, which is fine with me. It is my theory that on 5/16, the IV will boost to 150%+, which has been the case for the past three ER's (I don't know what it's done before that because I wasn't trading before that). If i'm right, the 5/17calls right now are pricing in the IV at 50%. Now even if it doesn't get to 150% (which it will), there's no way it will stay at 50%; that's for sure. NVDA is at 183 right now. **The play: 5/17 200c for 1.75-1.80ish (currently pricing in 50% IV, which is just silly).** I have a theory that if two conditions are met by 5/16, this play will be profitable: (1) NVDA does reach at least 191 by 5/16 (super possible; it may go even higher, to 193), and (2) the IV does go to 150%+ like it should. If these two conditions are met, THETA will be defeated/muted. I picked one up on Friday. I plan to pick up one more on Monday. If my prediction's right, I think these 200c contracts will be around $4.00. That's a 100%. Let's see. (I think it's worth looking into these things and experimenting a bit if one plans to trade long term, imo).
5. SQ. Looks like it established a bottom to me (maybe others who know TA better than me can comment?): 4hour: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/EJD9Kok0/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/EJD9Kok0/) Daily: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/6WDb6q91](https://www.tradingview.com/x/6WDb6q91/) .  Looks like SQ is in a following wedge, but has established a bottom with those LONG bottom candle sicks, confirmed by a Green candle with long bottom stick. This indicated, to my understanding, seller exhaustion. Here's an interesting play, inspired by this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk8vho/made\_it\_out\_of\_msft\_alive/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk8vho/made_it_out_of_msft_alive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) .   **The Play (1k profit, theta gang style):**  **Sell 67.50put and buy 67put, for credit of $16. Open 63 of these credit bull put spreads for $1008.** To keep the full $1k profit, SQ just has to close above 67.50 on Friday. I think this is quite likely, especially if this is going to be bullish week, which it's looking like to me. There is great loss protection, since the long put is so close in price to the short put. Theta should burn on this FD credit spread. SQ just has to hold 67.50 for five trading days. Open this spread on an SQ dip, for a higher credit, and then open however many (my goal is 1k credit profit). **Collateral is needed for this play: for 63 contracts, $3150 collateral is required.** That's not bad for possibility of making 1k. Of course, you can close these spreads anytime. Let's say SQ wants to test 70 this week, at least once, before getting rejected hard (i think this is quite possible), then close everything for a profit and release your collateral (i don't know how much profit this would yield).

1. ROKU. See what ROKU is trading at on wednesday. Then sell an insanely out the otm call (like 75) and buy a call as high as possible that will fill. In other words, there's no protection here; it's essentially the only way to play naked calls on RH. lol. Open as many as you like. The IV crush on ROKU will be apocalyptic. :) I will be doing this for free money on Wed.

# **Trade talks closing in on finish line as markets weigh inflation data, earnings in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/03/trade-talks-closing-in-on-finish-line-as-markets-weigh-inflation-data-earnings-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> A trade agreement between the U.S. and China could be a strong catalyst for stocks, even though analysts say the market may have already priced in much of the gains.
*****
> Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will travel to Washington for talks in the coming week, and sources have told CNBC a deal is possible by Friday. Trade has been one of the biggest overhangs for the market, but the prospect of successful talks has helped fuel the S&P 500′s 17% gain this year.
*****
> Besides trade in the coming week, investors are awaiting Friday’s inflation data, important after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comment Wednesday that weak inflation is transitory, signaling the Fed does not now have to consider an interest rate cut.
*****
> That comment from the Fed chief sent markets reeling, since many investors have been positioning in both bonds and stocks for a pre-emptive interest rate cut from the Fed. So Friday’s consumer price index will be key, even though unlike the inflation measure the Fed watches, CPI is expected to show inflation running slightly above the Fed’s 2% target in April. The Fed’s favored PCE deflator had core inflation at 1.6% in the first quarter.
*****
> To close out this week, the April jobs report crushed Wall Street’s expectations— adding a robust 263,000 new hires while the unemployment rate fell to 3.6%, the lowest level in a generation, the Labor Department said Friday. Wall Street had been expecting 190,000 hires and a 3.8% jobless rate.
*****
> “The more robust the incoming data is, the more time the Fed has to sit and watch and evaluate whether inflation is rising this year in the manner that they think it is. If the labor market is good enough, it allows the Fed to be patient, and let this thing play out,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. Gapen said if the data and inflation is instead weakening, the Fed would have to rethink its position later in the year.
*****
> Disney earnings
> Earnings will continue to be a factor in the week ahead, with about 50 S&P 500 companies reporting, including media names like Disney, News Corp and Viacom.
*****
> But if the trade negotiations are resolved, that will be the event that could have ramifications for markets and the economy for months to come.
*****
> But the reaction in the stock market may initially seem short-lived. “If the tariffs come off, you might get some readjustment to earnings expectations. So, you might have a nice couple of days, but I think it’s three-quarters of the way priced in, maybe a little bit more,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equities strategist at RBC.
*****
> She said some sectors have already benefited from the prospects of a deal. “The two I think are in focus are industrials and semis,” she said. As for semiconductors, “there’s been such a fierce rally in that space this year. Semis were sort of the pure play on the China fears and they rallied hard and fast. They’re starting to see some profit-taking.”
*****
> The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF is up 33.4% year-to-date.
*****
> Calvasina said the better-than-expected performance in S&P 500 first quarter earnings shows there will not be the earnings recession expected just a month ago. She said companies focused a lot on cost cutting to maintain their margins. According to Refinitiv, the S&P 500 companies are now expected to see profit growth of about 0.7%, compared to expectations for a contraction of 2% back on April 1.
*****
> “I think the market very much deserves the rally we’ve had,” she said. However, she sees limited upside and maintains a target of 2,950 on the S&P for year end. “We’re getting to the part of the year where we’re vulnerable to bad news. It doesn’t mean today is the top, but when we think about where we’re going to be at year end, it’s a good reason not to raise the target. We feel like we can overshoot in in the short term.”
*****
> “It’s probably a good time to take money off the table. We’ve said that things could weigh on the market in the second half,” she said.
*****
> Investors are also looking towards Omaha this weekend. Berkshire Hathaway was holding its annual meeting this Saturday, and that could generate plenty of headlines for investors who are Warren Buffett watchers. The investor already revealed to CNBC Thursday that his company was a buyer of Amazon.

# Strong Starts Hog Gains for the Year

> Big gains the first four months of 2019 have some Wall Street pundits and analysts concerned. While strong starts for the market for the first four months of the year don’t leave much for the rest of the year, it is by no means a negative implication or bearish indication. S&P 500 leads the pack with its 17.5% gain coming in at #3 since 1950. NASDAQ’s 22.0% gain is the 5th best first four month since 1971. DJIA’s 14.0% rise is number 9.

> In the tables below we have displayed the top 20 first four month gains for the three major U.S. market indices with the subsequent changes for May, Rest of the Year, “Worst Six Months” May-October, 2nd half July-December and full year performance. While most of the full year gains are clearly logged in these big first-four-month gains, there still upside to be had in the latter part of the year.

> As you might expect May is weakest for DJIA and S&P and the Worst Six Months are hit hardest mostly after the strongest starts. The major blemish is course in 1987, with other critical givebacks in 1971and 2011. Other significant issues arose in 1975, 1983, 1986 and1998. Basically, if you take 1987 out of the equation the rest of the year after strong starts aint so bad. Average gains are about equal to historical average annual gains. Rest of the year gains sans 1987: DJIA 7.3%, S&P 500 8.7%, NASDAQ 12.6%.

# Typical May Trading: Just a Couple of Positive Areas

> Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear “Sell in May.” But when exactly in May is the “best” time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May’s eighteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.

# The Power of Productivity

> The U.S. labor market may be kicking the economic expansion into another gear.

> Consistent productivity growth has been largely absent from the expansion, even as payrolls and wages have grown at a healthy clip. However, strong labor market trends and last year’s pickup in capital expenditures growth could be sparking a resurgence in productivity, which we think could be key to future economic growth.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, productivity in the first quarter rose at the fastest year-over-year pace since 2010.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Power-of-Productivity.png?ssl=1))**

> Increased business spending is the primary catalyst for higher productivity, as better equipment and training boosts output per worker, although a tightening labor market has also helped. Labor shortages and accelerating wage growth normally incentivize companies to invest in boosting output with current labor. In turn, workers may get paid more as output increases, which could flow through to higher consumer spending.

> Growing productivity also helps offset rising labor expenses, as companies get more output per dollar spent, which can help mitigate inflationary pressures and support healthy profit margins for U.S. companies. First quarter unit labor costs rose only 0.1% year over year, the slowest pace of growth since the fourth quarter of 2013.

> “Labor market strength has been a pillar of the expansion,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “Job creation and wage growth remain healthy, and increased productivity points to stronger output without significantly higher costs.”

> The April jobs report, released May 3, showed U.S. hiring hasn’t wavered amid global uncertainty and trade tensions. Nonfarm payrolls rose 263K, higher than estimates for a 190K gain. Average hourly earnings grew 3.2% year over year, around the fastest pace of the cycle, and at a level that should continue to bolster consumer confidence and support consumer spending. The unemployment rate fell to 3.6%, a cycle low.

*****

# More (Im)patience

> The Federal Reserve (Fed) has promised patience, but financial markets now want more.

> On Wednesday, Fed members unanimously voted to keep rates unchanged, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell repeated several times in his May 1 post-meeting press conference that further patience is appropriate. That patience, which soothed stocks earlier this year, spurred nearly a 1% intraday selloff in the S&P 500 Index.

> Investors have pointed to slowing consumer inflation as a case for lower rates, and bond markets have increasingly positioned for a rate cut. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, growth in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, has slowed in the first three months of this year, falling as the global economy has struggled with trade uncertainty.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Consumer-Inflation-Trailing-Away-from-Federal-reserve-Target.png?ssl=1))**

> While the pace of core PCE growth isn’t alarmingly slow, the downward trend over the past three months runs counter to the Fed’s intentions.

> Still, Powell attributed lower inflation to transitory factors. He also correctly noted that core PCE growth stayed close to 2% for much of 2018, so fundamentals before the first quarter volatility supported the Fed’s inflation target. Producer prices and wages have steadily risen over the past few months, and we expect businesses to eventually adjust their prices accordingly as demand picks up.

> “We think the trend of slowing consumer price growth is temporary and that inflation could pop higher as pricing pressures build,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “If consumer price growth picks up, we think there is a better chance of a rate hike later this year, rather than a cut.”

> Other parts of the U.S. economy are rebounding, so we don’t see a strong argument for a rate cut right now. At the very least, Powell made it clear that the Fed doesn’t have enough clarity to move policy in either direction, which is prudent given the persistent mixed signals in some data series. For now, the Fed remains in wait-and-see mode as trends settle and growth stabilizes.

*****

# Time to Sell in May? Part Deux

> As we noted earlier this week, these next six months historically have been the worst for stocks. That is why there’s a well-known investment axiom to “Sell in May and Go Away.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Next-Six-Months-Have-Been-the-Worst-on-Average.png?ssl=1))**

> However, that popular principle hasn’t rung true for most of this bull market.

> “Stocks have actually risen over this dreaded six-month stretch in six of the past seven years, while the S&P 500 Index has gained in May six consecutive years,” explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Blindly going to cash and waiting until after Halloween to re-invest hasn’t been the most profitable strategy lately.”

> The S&P 500 has bucked the seasonal trend recently, but we think a decisive midyear rally could be more difficult to come by this year. With the S&P 500 higher each of the first four months of 2019 and up more than 17.5% for the year (as of April 30), we think a consolidation or pullback could be warranted. As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, over the past 20 years stocks have spent the next several months in a sideways grind.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Next-6-Months-Could-Be-Choppy-1.png?ssl=1))**

> The average peak-to-trough correction during these worst six months is 11.1%. With conditions quite stretched near term, stocks could be vulnerable to a potential pullback over the coming months.

Both expired ITM with a price of around 1960ish.  So i'm very confused as to why they didn't just close the option and pay me the difference of the short sell and long call.  It does say pending along with this message:   

### Pending Shares

Once your contract has been exercised or assigned, we’ll hold the associated shares until we receive confirmation from the Options Clearing Corporation that all aspects of the exercise have cleared. You’ll be able to trade the shares before market open the day after expiration.

If something unusual occurs, like if you’re not assigned for an in-the-money call you sold, the pending state will be removed and your shares will be adjusted based on the updated information.

&#x200B;

But, I had a ROKU Bull debit spread expiring the same day ITM! it was sold 1 hour before market close..

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I this just due to the Options Clearing Corporation?  Because my RH account is saying I have a 185k negative buying power balance.  I figured with one being sold and one being bought if the price expired ITM i'd receive the difference of the Short sell and the long call.  Maybe someone can chime in?  Obviously seeing -185k is a cause for concern.

&#x200B;

My understanding of it is if both options expire out-of-the-money, the buyer loses and the seller gains the debit amount. If both options expire in-the-money, the spread buyer profits from the difference between the two strike prices minus the debit, which is the same amount that the spread seller loses. If only the near-strike option expires in the money, the buyer’s and seller’s profit or loss is the difference between the final price of the near-strike option and the spread debit/credit.",2019-05-03

* Dow futures were sharply lower this morning after President Donald Trump said that the U.S. will hike tariffs on goods imported from China. The Dow posted its second straight weekly drop last week, though the S&P 500 is up for two weeks in a row. The Nasdaq has six straight weekly gains. (CNBC)
* Chinese markets plunge more than 5% as US-China trade tensions escalate (CNBC)
* Trump said over the weekend that tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods will increase to 25% on Friday, despite repeated claims by the Trump administration in recent weeks that trade talks with Beijing were going well. The tariff rate on those goods was originally set at 10%. (CNBC)
* Goldman Sachs: Here’s what could happen next with the US-China trade war (CNBC)
* China says it’s still preparing for US trade talks — but won’t give details after new Trump threats (CNBC)
* Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA, BRKB) saw operating profit rise to $5.56 billion during the first quarter from $5.29 billion the prior year. Berkshire held its annual meeting over the weekend, and CEO Warren Buffett joins Becky Quick on “Squawk Box” this morning from 6am to 9am ET. (CNBC)
* Buffett knocks Elon Musk’s plan for Tesla to sell insurance: ‘It’s not an easy business’ (CNBC)
* Food distributor Sysco (SYY) and Tyson Foods (TSN) are set to issue quarterly earnings this morning, while AIG (AIG), International Flavors (IFF), KLA-Tencor (KLAC), Mosaic (MOS), and Rent-A-Center (RCII) will be out with earnings after today’s closing bell. (CNBC)
* There are no economic reports on the calendar for today.

* Democrats hope Mueller will testify May 15 (USA Today)
* Palestinian officials said an Egyptian-mediated ceasefire agreement was reached with Israel today to end a recent surge of violence in the Gaza Strip and southern Israel. Israeli officials did not comment on whether a truce had been reached. (Reuters)
* Investigators said the devastating Easter Sunday bombings that killed more than 250 people in Sri Lanka were locally planned and executed, without direct guidance from the Islamic State militant group. (WSJ)
* Boeing (BA) said a standard alert that had been disabled on the 737 Max jet due to a glitch was not necessary to safely operate the aircraft. The statement came after Southwest Airlines (LUV) said it was not informed about the disabled alert. (CNBC)
* Executive turnover at Kraft Heinz (KHC) is continuing as Chief Marketing Officer Eduardo Luz is leaving the company. Kraft Heinz announced last month its long-time CEO Bernardo Hees is stepping down on June 30. (CNBC)
* A closer look at Amazon’s (AMZN) delivery network illustrates why it is now ready to make one-day shipping the default for its Prime members. The vast delivery network is a result of significant investments over the past four years. (CNBC)
* More people are giving their pets CBD, a non-intoxicating cannabis compound, to ease pain and anxiety. CBD pet products could balloon to a $1.16 billion industry in the U.S. by 2022, the Brightfield Group estimates. (CNBC)

What is on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Monday, May 6th, 2019! :)**",2019-05-06
blywm7,18,37,wallstreetbets,I pick downright retarded options so you don't have to *mid-week Trade War edition*,0.86,1557306179.0,1557277379.0,"My initial post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bjkmmk/i\_pick\_downright\_retarded\_options\_so\_you\_dont/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bjkmmk/i_pick_downright_retarded_options_so_you_dont/) 

&#x200B;

I have to say, I was feeling pretty autistic headed into the week of 5/6. I had loaded up on 5/08 300 lotto calls at 0.01 per contract, 35 of them to be exact, truly a large amount of risk for my broke ass to be taking on. GE calls were printing tendies, and EA calls were churning up some sweet IV. My AMD position was sitting at a lofty 28.2, well up from my cost basis of 26.8, and mostly (thank god) I was cash. Needless to say, I'm a complete fucking retard. Before I get into my spur of the moment, reactionary, completely retarded and impulsive update to last week's post, let's recap just how poorly my retarded picks have done so far: 

&#x200B;

EA(bullish): So, not gonna lie, this is all thanks to u/SoRefreshing, I'm way too retarded to identify a good play like this. Currently looks like it will open above 100, up about 8%. Think August/September 110-115s will profit quite nicely tomorrow if this holds. Good thing I bought 5/10 120 calls instead, gonna be feeling pretty fucking retarded come 9:30am. Regardless, probably will see some profit taking but looks good coming out of earnings. I expect upward momentum to continue.

&#x200B;

WYNN(bullish): Wow. I actually still think this will be a good play because I must be fucked in the head. If you bought calls already you're probably hating yourself, but I did say these picks were retarded. Currently, WYNN is down 11 points from the time I posted. Trade war sensitive? Maybe less Chineses will visit Wynn resorts or something. Who the fuck knows, just buy calls right before earnings if you really want to feel like a brick.

&#x200B;

ROKU (bearish): Let me just start by saying fuck ROKU. This stock has done a whole lot of fucking nothing since the last post, which probably indicates that buyers are lining up to fuck me straight in the ass. Anticipating some sort of runup to earnings, I've of course held off from buying puts til right before ER. Now I can buy them at peak IV- all according to plan (I am screaming internally). If you weren't as retarded as me and bought your puts already, then godspeed, retard. 

&#x200B;

GE (Bullish as fuck): So, for starters, if you picked up some 10.5-11 calls around when I posted then you had a great window for a not retarded trade or two. Twice, the stock went to the low 10s and then back up to hit a high of 10.50. Good shit, GE. Not gonna lie, I just like this play all around still, mainly because I'm dense. They've proven pretty resilient so far for a trade war sensitive stock, and even though they've given up a lot of their earnings gains, I think it's still a great play. Thinking of playing 2-3 month, .5-1 point otm calls all the way to next ER, because I'm actually a mongoloid.

&#x200B;

How did the wildcards perform? 

Using a scale of 1-10, with 1 being not retarded, and 10 being drooling idiocy:

 

AMD 5/17 35c: 10

&#x200B;

SQ 5/3 90c: 10

&#x200B;

NVDA 5/17 230c: 10

&#x200B;

ATVI 5/31 70c: 10 

&#x200B;

If you played any of these, tally up your point total and grade yourself using a scale from 10-40, with 10 being objectively, scientifically retarded and 40 being so unfathomably retarded that any sane person would go mad trying to comprehend it, like some Lovecraftian eldritch retardation of some sort. 

&#x200B;

Moving right along, let's get into my spur of the moment, revised Trade War survival kit. It will come in handy, if you believe the only way to survive is to lose money. 

 Would put a disclaimer here about not being a registered anything or person you should follow or trust in any capacity, but that much is painfully fucking obvious. I may not play all or any of these, and you almost certainly shouldn't play any of them, but here are the shitty plays I'm unfortunately thinking of making right now for some short term, degenerate, get rich quick fuckery: 

&#x200B;

ACB (bullish): Aurora Cannabis, baby. I stay high 24/7. This allows me to burn tons of cash, while staying functionally retarded- not unlike this company. Weed is trade war proof son, get with the fucking times. Beverages go online in Canada sometime this fall which should lift the sector and I like this stock anywhere under 9. Looking to buy some stock and catch an earnings run up, but honestly the whole sector could go downwards into ER (most report next week). If there is a run-down into ER, I'll definitely be picking up calls before they report. Could be early on this, but I had to get high to distract myself from this trade war and honestly I'm kind of retarded.

&#x200B;

PINS (bullish): Fuck yeah, bitch. When the trade bombs are falling all around you and trade refugees are seeking shelter up your ass, your best friend's guts are in your lap after he took a trade bullet straight to the portfolio,  you know who sure as fuck won't be affected? White women, ages 18-35. Like my other pick, this one showed great retard strength through the first two days of the legendary trade war recession of May 2019. I expect the bleeding to slow down and eventually stop rather fast on this one, the fundamentals are too lit and grils are their main revenue source, buy calls on further dips and buy stock if it really drops- which I doubt it will because I'm somewhat special. 

&#x200B;

YANG (bullish): Being bullish on this one is like being bearish on China, or something. I'm not sure, this whole stock market thing is confusing. The way I see it, we are unlikely to reach a trade agreement on Friday. There will be more carnage ahead. If we DO reach an agreement on Friday, the terms of the agreement are almost certainly going to make China's dick look mucho small. I think the odds China is green these next few months is slim to none. You can buy YANG, calls on YANG, puts on YINN, or puts on CQQQ. Pick your poison, oh retarded assassin of Chinese meme stocks. Go forth, and lose money because of your lack of understanding of all things economic and geopolitical.

bnfd9i,31,40,wallstreetbets,Let's discuss Telaria,0.87,1557628567.0,1557599767.0,"Hey gang, some hopefully helpful DD here on what I believe it a 3-4 bagger down the road.

The company is Telaria, a ""sell side"" digital advertising company that can produce, in-house, digital video content for multitudes of platforms. One of their largest contract is with Hulu, and they also have contracts with 5 out of the 7 largest digital advertising firms, or firms on the ""buy side"" of advertising.

**BACKGROUND**

In 2017, then-Tremor Video (now Telaria) was both in the buy and sell side of the business, but didn't really do both of them well. In late 2017, they decided to abandon the buy side, and focus solely on content generation for the sell side, and re-branded as Telaria. They do this through technoogy and service partners searching out premium video content.The name for their company, according to their website, is **""a derivation of the Greek word Talaria, which is the name of the winged sandals worn by Hermes, the messenger of the gods. We use this spelling because our core focus has always been video – from the smallest mobile screens to the largest televisions.""**

**FUNDAMENTALS**

Ticker Symbol: $TLRA  
Current Stock Price: $8.32  
Market Cap: $365 million  
52 week MA: 102.43%  
Glassdoor Review: 4.5/5 stars (100% approval of CEO)

**IN THE WEEDS**

Piecing some of this together from their recent quarterly report news coverage, but from 18Q1 to 19Q1, revenue increased 42% to 13.6 million. This is also an increase in 31% from Q4. Analysts were only expecting a 23% rise from Q4.

What's driving the huge increases? Connected TV (or CTV). Year over year, Telaria saw a whopping 169% increase in revenue from connected TV advertising. At the beginning of 2019, Telaria locked in a contract with Hulu. CTV now accounts for 38% of the company's total revenue.

Just as important is guidance. Management raised its guidance for the full year, guiding for revenue between $66 million and $70 million and adjusted EBITDA between $2 million and $5 million. Prior to raised guidance, management expected 2019 revenue between $63 million and $67 million and adjusted EBITDA between $1 million and $4 million.

**BEHIND THE SCENES**

Now, why is it important to differentiate between buy and sell side. The buy side of advertising is already riddled with many competitiors, and some are larger than others. However, the ""harder"" part (my emphasis) is on the sell side. The sell side is charged with putting together the content that not only does what the advertiser/client wants, but that is also acceptable to the platform (see: Hulu/Roku) in what they would  WANT its content consumers to take in. Furthermore, the sell side is less dominated by larger players in the digital video advertising space, so this gives Telaria a moat for the future.

**THE FUTURE**

Ummm, are any of us expecting a return to the ABC/NBC/CBS dominated world? Even 24-cable news is losing its luster for streaming ""connected"" TV. So, you want players who can do this job well and can have a notable ROI for advertisers. And with more and more streaming platforms either established or coming on line (Hulu, Disney+, Fire TV, Netflix, Tubi TV, etc...) the need for experts and winners in this field will grow. Telaria seems to be setting itself up for future success.

Additionally, for a company like this to abandon its previous business model, turn around, and accelerate like this in less than 24 months -- damn impressive.

In my opinion, easily a future $1 billion company.",2019-05-10

Neither company is currently cash flow positive or reports any accounting earnings. 

With the current market sentiment, why do you think the market is pricing these two companies so highly? 

In the bull case of Shop it could be understood that it could have the potential of amazon as they have the best in class software for their primary business. The best case is that they are reliant on drop shipping and that current market participants are starting to seriously compete.

For roku the bull case is that they are building an ecosystem of entertainment that could potentially generate huge earnings from advertisements/subscription based models. The bear case is that they have no moat and that their product is not unique.

Either way, in any other different periods in history save 2000, neither company could be traded at such multiples. As a comparison, amazon never traded above 10x revenue.",2019-05-24

Notes On last week

Last week turned out much better than I expected. Dow had its largest one week gain of 2019 after FED alluded to the fact, they may consider cutting interest rates. Obviously, the punch in the dick was Trumps announcement of tariffs on Mexico the day after I created the post above. While we are now well above those levels and even appear to have a trade deal with them now, it was not very fun holding calls that day. Ended up rolling them out so Theta didn’t fuck me over. 

I ended up selling to early on Thursday, but the Friday jobs number could have gone either way so I decided to get out. I am now net delta negative after opening some positions Friday, more on that latter. I appreciate the support the last post got along with people sending me pictures of their returns, was cool to be able to help some people out.

On to this week

I’ll start off by saying this won’t be the same type of post I made last week as well as it may be considerably longer. Focusing more on the model I use, if that doesn’t float your boat, you don’t have to read this, or do and shit post below. Either one works for me. 

The data

1. I’ll skip the SKEW index for now. It has increased since my last post but day to day it is not a particularly helpful indicator. 

2. [https://imgur.com/a/nTjPATV](https://imgur.com/a/nTjPATV) The 10 period moving average of the VIX call put ratio has increased a fair amount since my last post indicating there are increasingly more long bets on the VIX over the course of this rally. I will also add that the VIX has held up surprisingly well the past week, indicating the larger insinuations and traders that trade SPX options are buying more downside protection even with this rally. **Whenever VIX and SPX have a positive correlation, it generally is not a good sign**.

3. [https://imgur.com/a/qUJX49s](https://imgur.com/a/qUJX49s) The DIX has fallen slightly over this rally, nothing to shocking though and is still fairly high. Something that does concern me is the GEX. The GEX is a measure of market makers hedging obligations and the sharp rise over the past week looks somewhat similar to that of May 16 2019, and Nov 7 2018. Not an ideal time to buy after the GEX spikes. For more info see [https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/docs](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/docs)

4. From a TA perspective, a **pull back to start the week is by far the most likely outcome**. For SPY QQQ and IWM, there is bearish divergence on the PPO and Momentum and the Slow stochastic is about to cross below 80 on the 30 min chart. The hourly tell similar storied but the Slow Stochastic is slightly farther from 80. Look for this to stick below 80 as a sign the short-term trend has changed. [https://imgur.com/a/9g9M9ru](https://imgur.com/a/9g9M9ru)

The model

I have made some significant changes to the model I use. I decided to go from using inputs based solely off of the close of SPY, to using a **broader array of inputs such as oil prices and treasury yields** as well as I ramped up the number of Epochs used. Unfortunately, I have decided to keep the exact data/input structure I used private for my own reasons, mainly because I feel as if it is my secret sauce. I’ve spent quite a bit of time working on it and making the methods more well-known doesn’t exactly do me any favors. That being said, if you have any questions/criticisms regarding the model, please look at my older posts before asking them and I may or may not answer them. 

Here are the back test for the past ten weeks [https://imgur.com/a/ceuKDCr](https://imgur.com/a/ceuKDCr), sorry for the formatting, I didn’t feel like making each one its own picture. An important note, is that I switched from having the forecast and SPY having separate axis, to having a **shared y-axis using a percentage change from t=0**. One reason I think I missed timed my long entry last week is that I was using a relative scale. 

If I had used the % scale, I would have seen that the model was predicting a 4% downside to start off the period, but SPY had only fell 1.5% when I was looking to go long. Hindsight is 20/20 I guess. The only back test that did not turn out so good was the one starting 3/27. While SPY did finish that period with a slight pull back, the model predicted a much more significant down turn which we did not see. 

Here is the sum off the back tests along with the forecast for the next two weeks: [https://imgur.com/a/3AUFoe1](https://imgur.com/a/3AUFoe1). I went with the dual axis as over a long period time using a percentage method separate the graphs so that they are not as easy to compare, seeing as they are 20 day forecasts I think that this makes the most sense over a long period of time. **The correlation between the forecasts and SPY is .305**. Not perfect but doesn’t appear to be random. I will have to get a larger sample size to confirm this latter. 

Here is the forecast on a % terms: [https://imgur.com/a/Ixzn0eQ](https://imgur.com/a/Ixzn0eQ). I will be looking for a pull back early this weak to enter long positions and close my 6/14 call credit spreads, **looking for about 284-285 on SPY**. From my back tests it is clear that some movements are exaggerated and often don’t occur exactly on the predicted day, so I think it is safe to say you should not expect a 4% drop Monday. You’ll have to use some other data point to confirm a near term bottom.

Looking at the forecast together with the data, I will be playing call credit spreads, continuing to hold my SPY, V, and ROKU call credit spreads I opened Friday, and looking to get into ITM call debt spreads late this week. I will add that holding naked calls in this environment does not offer a favorable risk to reward ratio. ITM debt spreads will be my preferred strategy until the trade/economic outlook is clearer. Especially sense the Mexico trade news came out after hours Friday, I have no idea how the futures will react.

As always, ***This Is Not Advice To Buy Or Sell Any Security*** and you need to do your own research to come to your own conclusions. This is just a summary of the data I am looking at along with my plan for the next two weeks, which is subject to change without updating everyone who reads this.",2019-06-07

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

cd90ir,50,40,wallstreetbets,SPY (SPX) big picture: breakout from 18month consolidation! (this might be just the beginning? where's the top?!),0.89,1563171018.0,1563142218.0,"(this is all my opinion. It IS NOT ADVICE).

&#x200B;

Going back to January 2018 to now: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/JZLDPhfi/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/JZLDPhfi/)

Weekly picture: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/Gd0frAGx/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Gd0frAGx/)

And let me take you back to 1998 and zoom out on Monthly chart: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/P5fKCQrr/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/P5fKCQrr/)

&#x200B;

And now we zoom into where we are: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/tyd6LiKw/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tyd6LiKw/)

You can see SPY pulled back to make sure the breakout was legit (blue arrows). You can see that we're in new territory and SPY is establishing new support/resistance lines. So if SPY pulls back, wait and see how SPY does at those lines. (Please add an ""ish"" to the end of those three numbers on the chart. For example, 297.20ish). 

&#x200B;

Some thoughts: 

**1) Don't call the top and buy puts like a dumb auti until SPY falls back into the shaded box, imo. \*\*295\*\* The trend is UP right now, people!** If SPY drops below 295, you might try puts because the fall may accelerate. Otherwise, if you're buying puts, (presumably) you're just trying to make money on scalping technical pullbacks (which is difficult but legit and what we all try to do every day (think of ROKU all year). 

Note: **for SPX,** the main key battle line is 2954, imo. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/hsCuGL3f/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hsCuGL3f/)

Unlike many others, I am not of the view that SPY 234 must be retested. 

**2) IWM.** SPY and QQQ have been making new ATH's in this raging bull market. Why is IWM lagging so hard? I think it is because small caps are more dependent on debt, and so until there is an OFFICIAL rate cut announced, IWM will lag. But it's gonna fucking FLY when/if a rate cut is officially announced. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/hLQfGz0v/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hLQfGz0v/)

The absolute key number for IWM is 160. If it breaks 160 into 161, it will FLY FLY FLY (imo).

 **3) AAPL:**  Think of a ticker that hasn't reached a new ATH yet in this raging bull market.... AAPL! sexy gap fill at 210.32

cin69u,185,202,investing,Stock picks and discussion for bulls and bears (7/29 - 8/2 trading week and beyond!),0.92,1564291491.0,1564262691.0,"Hey y'all!

**\*\*\*\*\*EDIT: I'll be posting flash stock picks and thoughts on my reddit wall sporadically throughout the week. Make sure you keep an eye out for those! \*\*\*\*\***

I will be creating weekly posts (depending on the feedback) with a few stocks to keep on your watchlists for bulls and bears, and for short- and long- term investors. These posts are meant to start a discussion about **individual** stocks, their technicals and fundamentals. My ultimate goal with these posts is simply to share good DD. I believe in good karma and I think helping others succeed at trading translates to just better luck =). All of this comes after almost a decade investing in stocks and now with a PhD in statistics and machine learning skills in the bag. And no, I will never charge you or ask you to join any mailing list or discord. That's not how I roll (you can see my post history to verify this yourself!).

I'm of the idea that, **if accompanied by in-depth TA and FA**, investing on individual stocks has way more potential for profit than major indexes in the short-, medium- and long-terms. I generally focus on stocks that I know well, but please feel free to share your own DD on stocks you know well yourself.  With that said, here's a list of stocks to watch for bulls and bears for the trading week ahead, as well as in the long term. Again, these come from a combination of in-depth FA/TA. Let me know what your thoughts are below:

***If you're feeling bullish about the market this week (for traders AND investors)-***

* $BIIB; $OKTA; $MDB; $DIS; $TTD (I'd consider entry on Tuesday); $ROKU (DO NOT HOLD UNTIL EARNINGS!). These should all print some good tendies
* *Bullish power play:\*\** $CRWD, $GD, $CGC, $ALXN, $CRM, $AYX are all high risk/high reward potential plays
* *Bullish earnings plays:\*\*\** $ILMN (Mon AH); $AMGN (Tues AH); $TWLO, $HUM (Weds AH); $ETSY, $MPC (Thurs AH)

For those investing in the long term, I would recommend considering starting positions in any of these except $CGC, $CRM, $ROKU and $ILMN (these four are included only for options traders **for the week**).

***If you're feeling bearish about the market this week -***

* *Bearish:* $TIF; $CVNA; $IIPR; $PYPL (just for the week, bullish in the long term); $CWH
* *Bearish power play:\*\* $*NFLX; $LYFT; $SFIX; $NKE; $PINS (will likely come down until earnings; bullish *for* earnings),
* *Bearish earnings plays:\*\*\** $SIRI (Tues BO); $SHOP, $YETI (Thurs BO); $RACE (Fri BO)

For those investing in the long term, I would avoid/sell all of the above, except $PYPL, $IIPR, $SHOP and $CVNA. If you're holding $LYFT or $PINS stocks, keep holding!

**\*\*Keep in mind that EARNINGS PLAYS ARE RISKIER PLAYS, by default**

\*\*\*Power plays are also, in my books, a lot riskier/more uncertain than others listed

**Disclaimer:** What I share with you is the product of hours of research I do to build **my own daily stock watchlist**. I trade these stocks (not all, and especially not all at once) because I see (up or down) swing potential for the day/week/month. Of course, trade at your own discretion and use the stocks for your watchlist. If you're feeling confident and see some momentum, follow your <3.

**These predictions are based on the expectation that we will have a quarter-point cut in interest rates, which is the most likely case scenario according to investors right now.**

# **Perfect summer storm brewing for stock correction as trade war simmers and more Fed action awaited  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/perfect-storm-building-for-market-correction.html)**
*****
> With new risks from trade wars, stocks head into the final weeks of summer vulnerable to a pull back or even correction.
*****
> The market was down sharply in the past week, buffeted first by disappointment over the Fed’s more hawkish-than-expected policy outlook. Then they were beaten down by fears President Donald Trump is starting a new front in the trade wars with China that is unlikely to end any time soon.
*****
> “The real issue as to why there’s going to be a correction in our view is there’s a massive, massive vacuum here,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivative strategy at BTIG. “In essence, it’s a month and a half of a vacuum, if you think about the direction of the rhetoric. ... The issues are China, the issues are the Fed and the issues are Brexit. In the first tow, you’re almost not going to hear anything.”
*****
> Trump, in threatening new tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods on Thursday, said the tariffs would go into effect on Sept. 1 unless China acts, but no new talks are expected before September. Economists said if the tariffs are put in place, the risks of a U.S. recession rise, particularly if businesses step back from investment, and possibly even hiring. But that could also prompt the Fed to cut interest rates to rescue the economy when it meets in September.
*****
> After a deluge of corporate headlines in the past several weeks, the earnings season is also winding down with just about 60 major companies reporting in the week ahead, and there are no really significant economic reports until the middle of the month.
*****
> Emanuel said the S&P 500 could see a decline to about 2,789, though he still expects to see 3,000 at the end of the year. Stocks started the past week near all-time highs, and the S&P 500 was was down more than 3% in the past week, but still up about 17% for the year-to-date. Odds are high that stocks pull back in August, since for the past eight years, the S&P 500 was negative during August in six of them.
*****
> Emanuel said if stocks decline too much or too long, he expects to see some action from the White House that will halt the selling.
*****
> “If you’re the president, there’s no way you’re going to allow an economic slowdown in an election year,” said Emanuel.
*****
> Barry Knapp, managing partner at Ironsides Macroeconomics, said Friday the escalation of the trade wars has made him more risk adverse, and he would lighten up holdings in the sectors he had favored—industrials, technology and transportation stocks.
*****
> “We could have a correction ... then we’ll have to see how the policy makers respond to it,′ Knapp said. “The risks are significant. I think we’ll get a correction. ... We could trade back to the May lows, somewhere around 2,750. then we’ll see how the administration responds. This was a seasonally vulnerable period.”
*****
> The Fed cut its target fed funds rate range Wednesday for the first time in a decade, but it does not have another meeting until Sept. 17, though Fed official hold their annual symposium in Jackson Hole at the end of August.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell disappointed markets when he said the Fed was in a “midcycle adjustment,” not a longer term rate cutting cycle but by Friday, futures markets were indicating a nearly 100% chance the Fed will cut interest rates in September.
*****
> “Clearly from the Fed, you’re going to get silence, until the end of the month in Jackson Hole where you may hear something but nothing of materiality,” said Emanuel. “All the Chinese leadership is by the seaside for the next couple of weeks...what you’re going to get for the next two weeks is next to total silence.”
*****
> Emanuel said Brexit is also a risk for markets, as the U.K. gets closer to the Oct. 31 deadline to leave the European Union. “In all likelihood, if you hear something between now and then, it’s basically going to increase the perception that brinkmanship toward the Oct. 31 deadline becomes more a reality every day, and this is reflected in the fact the British sterling is collapsing,” he said. The market has been speculating that the odds of a hard Brexit are increasing, meaning Britain leaves the EU with no plan.
*****
> Interest rates and currency wars
> Currency markets were volatile in the past week, but the dollar index was basically flat by Friday afternoon. Traders were monitoring both the moves in the foreign exchange market and fixed income markets.
*****
> As for the bond market, the declines in yields in the past week were dramatic, with about a 30 basis point move in the 10-year yield in just two days. Treasury yields were bouncing along 2016 levels. The 10-year moved from about 2.07% ahead of the Fed news to less than 1.85% It was at 1.87% Friday afternoon.
*****
> Yields, which move opposite price, also had moved lower on the Trump trade threats.
*****
> “Now everybody is waiting for the next tweet. Unfortunately, there’s no economics calendar for when those come out,′ said Jon Hill, rate strategist at BMO.
*****
> Hill said traders will be watching the three auctions, $38 billion in 3-year notes Tuesday; a record $27 billion 10-years Wednesday and the record $19 billion 30-year long bond auction, on Thursday.
*****
> Hill said the market will be watching ISM nonmanufacturing data Tuesday to see if the services side of the economy is still holding up. “It’s been a point of continued strength,” he said, noting at the same time manufacturing has been in decline.
*****
> Knapp said he is also worried that the dollar could strengthen on the trade war, and hurt emerging market currencies and U.S. profits. He noted that the Chinese currency weakened against the dollar overnight.
*****
> He said he is concerned currency volatility could “just start to have this big disruption that could be another factor that would just bleed into risk markets like the equity market.”

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 8/2/19

> Economic data may have taken a bit of a backseat amidst the FOMC meeting Wednesday and tariff headlines at the tail end of the week, but the US still had a heavy slate with 38 total releases.

> Data was broadly weaker with almost twice as many releases coming in weaker (20) than stronger (11) relative to forecasts (or the prior release when there was no consensus forecast). The Dallas Fed kicked off the week with a weaker than expected reading on manufacturing activity, but it was an improvement from June’s level of negative 12.1. In other manufacturing data, on Thursday we got Markit and ISM PMIs which were mixed. While Markit was stronger, the headline reading of ISM was weaker; new orders did improve, however. Headline factory orders were also weaker, but excluding transportation they were unchanged. As forecasted, personal income and spending weakened while inflation came in at a slower than expected pace on Tuesday. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence indices were the main bright spot of the week with stronger readings across the board. Claims data continued to show a slower pace of improvement on Thursday as both initial and continuing claims came in above expectations. Meanwhile, Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls report was the most inline with expectations since October 2012, coming in only 1K below forecasts of 165K.


> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-EcoT2.png))**

> Economic data is much lighter next week. The non-manufacturing portions of ISM and Markit PMIs are due on Monday. JOLTS and consumer credit are out on Wednesday. Producer inflation gauges are set to be released Friday.

# Fakeouts

> Throughout the course of the entire year, large caps have been leading the market higher, and they are the only market cap range of the equity market to actually make new highs in the most recent leg higher for equities. After this week's pullback, though, the S&P 500 is coming perilously close to breaking through support at the prior highs from April and last fall. A close below those levels today would not be a great mood-setter for the bulls heading into the weekend.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-SPX.png))**

> For Mid and Small Caps, the picture is even less optimistic. The S&P 400 Mid Cap index never came close to a new high in the most recent rally, but it did appear to break its downtrend from the highs late last year. But that breakout quickly turned to a fakeout this week as the S&P 400 broke back down below its prior downtrend line and is breaking below the 50-DMA today.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-MID.png))**

> For the small-cap Russell 2000, it's an identical picture. In this case, the break above the downtrend line was even more short-lived, and like the S&P 400, the Russell 2000 is not only back below its 50-DMA, but it also isn't that far from breaking below its 200-DMA.

# Earnings Season Déjà Vu

> Is it happening again? After what has to this point been a perfectly good earnings season for the US stock market sending the S&P 500 to new all-time highs in the process, the President spoiled the party yesterday when he tweeted that a new round of tariffs would be instituted on Chinese Imports. Stocks had erased all of their declines from Powell's Wednesday press conference by mid-day Thursday, but then the President’s tweet sent equity markets reeling with the Dow falling more than 1%, while the yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell back below 2%.

> If this whole scenario sounds familiar to you, that’s because we saw the same thing last quarter. Remember back in April when the S&P 500 rallied to new highs in the early weeks of earnings season? There was a feeling then that the market was finally breaking out of its rut and on the path to a sustained breakout. But then over the first weekend of May, on a Sunday afternoon no less, the President sent out a series of tweets outlining his plan for increased tariffs on Chinese imports. The following Monday, the market opened lower and kept falling throughout the month. By the end of May, the S&P 500 was down 6.6% for the month, making it the worst May for the S&P 500 since 2010. August has historically been an iffy month for the stock market as many on Wall Street take vacations and try to relax, but if the market follows the earnings season script from last quarter, this will be an August of little rest.

# President Takes Matters into His Own Hands

> The President has been frustrated with the Federal Reserve’s prior rate hikes and now the lack of a more substantial cut in rates. Just the other day, Trump was quoted as saying, “Obama had zero interest rates, we have ‘normalized’ rates. While the Fed hasn’t helped the President’s cause, he has seemingly taken matters into his own hands with his policy towards China. Each time he ratchets up the rhetoric against China, it tends to put additional downward pressure on interest rates, and following Thursday’s tweets, the yield on the 10-year plummetted below 1.9%.

> Ironically enough, the last time the 10-year yield was this low was on Election Day 2016. While short-term borrowing costs are up as the FOMC has hiked rates during Trump's time in office, the yield on the 10-year isn’t much different. Under the eight years of President Obama, the yield on the 10-year averaged 2.47%, while under Trump the average yield has been 2.57%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-10-Year-Yield.png))**

> The chart below shows a shorter-term look at the 10-year yield over the last year and it has practically been in free-fall the entire time. Ever since late 2018, every time the yield has attempted to make a move above its 50-DMA, it has reversed lower, with the most recent leg lower in May coinciding with another series of tweets concerning tariffs on Chinese goods.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080119-10YR-Yield.png))**

> While not a lot of stocks have benefitted from the President’s policy tweets on Chinese tariffs, the impact of lower interest rates has been cheered on by the homebuilders as they have practically been a completely inverse image of the move in rates. Just yesterday, the group hit a new high before pulling back a bit, but lower long-term interest rates mean lower mortgage payments, and that helps to make housing more affordable for millions of millennials looking for a place of their own.

# Outside Day for Gold (GLD)

> Even though assets have been selling off across the board in response to Wednesday's Fed decision and the President's announcement of increased tariffs yesterday, there is one bullish point to be found. Yesterday, gold (GLD) had initially moved slightly lower around the open but then surged into the close, finishing the day only a couple of cents off of the intraday high. Not only did GLD fully recoup the morning's losses, but it also gained back the previous day's losses and then some. This outside day/bullish engulfing pattern is typically seen as a bullish technical signal.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GLD.png))**

> This pattern has occurred a total of 35 times in the history of the Gold ETF (GLD). Below we show the 10 previous times that this pattern was observed after not having occurred in the previous six months. Despite being a bullish setup, performance in the next week has actually had a negative bias with an average return of -0.57%. The past five times have seen a loss in the following week. Likewise, three months out sees better than average returns but the probability of GLD trading higher is the just the same as a coinflip. But, generally, in the months and year after, GLD continues to trend higher on average with more consistent gains in the next month, 6 months, and year periods. Returns are also better than normal across these time frames.

# Solid Jobs Growth in July

> The job market continues to be a pillar of strength for the U.S. economy.

> Nonfarm payrolls rose 164,000 in July, in line with consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released August 2. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Solid Jobs Growth in July, job creation has slowed slightly this year amid the aging economic expansion, but not to levels that concern us. The 12-month average payrolls gain through July was 187,000, still an above-average pace for the expansion.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NSNykYz.png))**

> Strength in the job market is especially important these days as U.S. consumers increasingly bear the weight of economic growth. Consumer activity added 2.9 percentage points to second quarter gross domestic product (GDP), carrying GDP growth to 2.1%.

> Initial jobless claims, a leading economic indicator, have also pointed to firm labor-market conditions. The four-week average for unemployment claims fell to the fifth-lowest level of the expansion through July 26.

> “We’ve been encouraged by the labor market’s resiliency amid recent global uncertainty,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “A solid labor market should continue to bolster consumer confidence and buoy economic activity.”

> Average hourly earnings grew 3.2% year over year in July, a faster pace than June’s growth and at a healthy clip for the U.S. consumer. Wages constitute about 70% of business costs, so we’re hoping meaningful pay increases will eventually help lift consumer inflation, countering weakness in global demand. The unemployment rate climbed to 3.7%, still near a cycle low.

# August: Better in Pre-Election Years, But Still Not Great

> Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best month from 1901 to 1951. In 1900, 37.5% of the population was farming. Now that less than 2% farm, August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 31 years, 1988-2018 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.

> In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve modestly: #7 DJIA, #8 S&P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #9 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000 which is unchanged.

> Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011 and 2013 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline. A strong August in 2014 of S&P 3.8% and NASDAQ 4.8% preceded corrections of 7.4% and 8.4% respectively from mid-September to mid-October.

cljv1u,28,61,wallstreetbets,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 5th, 2019",0.92,1564874274.0,1564845474.0,"Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 5th, 2019.

# **Perfect summer storm brewing for stock correction as trade war simmers and more Fed action awaited  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/perfect-storm-building-for-market-correction.html)**
*****
> With new risks from trade wars, stocks head into the final weeks of summer vulnerable to a pull back or even correction.
*****
> The market was down sharply in the past week, buffeted first by disappointment over the Fed’s more hawkish-than-expected policy outlook. Then they were beaten down by fears President Donald Trump is starting a new front in the trade wars with China that is unlikely to end any time soon.
*****
> “The real issue as to why there’s going to be a correction in our view is there’s a massive, massive vacuum here,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivative strategy at BTIG. “In essence, it’s a month and a half of a vacuum, if you think about the direction of the rhetoric. ... The issues are China, the issues are the Fed and the issues are Brexit. In the first tow, you’re almost not going to hear anything.”
*****
> Trump, in threatening new tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods on Thursday, said the tariffs would go into effect on Sept. 1 unless China acts, but no new talks are expected before September. Economists said if the tariffs are put in place, the risks of a U.S. recession rise, particularly if businesses step back from investment, and possibly even hiring. But that could also prompt the Fed to cut interest rates to rescue the economy when it meets in September.
*****
> After a deluge of corporate headlines in the past several weeks, the earnings season is also winding down with just about 60 major companies reporting in the week ahead, and there are no really significant economic reports until the middle of the month.
*****
> Emanuel said the S&P 500 could see a decline to about 2,789, though he still expects to see 3,000 at the end of the year. Stocks started the past week near all-time highs, and the S&P 500 was was down more than 3% in the past week, but still up about 17% for the year-to-date. Odds are high that stocks pull back in August, since for the past eight years, the S&P 500 was negative during August in six of them.
*****
> Emanuel said if stocks decline too much or too long, he expects to see some action from the White House that will halt the selling.
*****
> “If you’re the president, there’s no way you’re going to allow an economic slowdown in an election year,” said Emanuel.
*****
> Barry Knapp, managing partner at Ironsides Macroeconomics, said Friday the escalation of the trade wars has made him more risk adverse, and he would lighten up holdings in the sectors he had favored—industrials, technology and transportation stocks.
*****
> “We could have a correction ... then we’ll have to see how the policy makers respond to it,′ Knapp said. “The risks are significant. I think we’ll get a correction. ... We could trade back to the May lows, somewhere around 2,750. then we’ll see how the administration responds. This was a seasonally vulnerable period.”
*****
> The Fed cut its target fed funds rate range Wednesday for the first time in a decade, but it does not have another meeting until Sept. 17, though Fed official hold their annual symposium in Jackson Hole at the end of August.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell disappointed markets when he said the Fed was in a “midcycle adjustment,” not a longer term rate cutting cycle but by Friday, futures markets were indicating a nearly 100% chance the Fed will cut interest rates in September.
*****
> “Clearly from the Fed, you’re going to get silence, until the end of the month in Jackson Hole where you may hear something but nothing of materiality,” said Emanuel. “All the Chinese leadership is by the seaside for the next couple of weeks...what you’re going to get for the next two weeks is next to total silence.”
*****
> Emanuel said Brexit is also a risk for markets, as the U.K. gets closer to the Oct. 31 deadline to leave the European Union. “In all likelihood, if you hear something between now and then, it’s basically going to increase the perception that brinkmanship toward the Oct. 31 deadline becomes more a reality every day, and this is reflected in the fact the British sterling is collapsing,” he said. The market has been speculating that the odds of a hard Brexit are increasing, meaning Britain leaves the EU with no plan.
*****
> Interest rates and currency wars
> Currency markets were volatile in the past week, but the dollar index was basically flat by Friday afternoon. Traders were monitoring both the moves in the foreign exchange market and fixed income markets.
*****
> As for the bond market, the declines in yields in the past week were dramatic, with about a 30 basis point move in the 10-year yield in just two days. Treasury yields were bouncing along 2016 levels. The 10-year moved from about 2.07% ahead of the Fed news to less than 1.85% It was at 1.87% Friday afternoon.
*****
> Yields, which move opposite price, also had moved lower on the Trump trade threats.
*****
> “Now everybody is waiting for the next tweet. Unfortunately, there’s no economics calendar for when those come out,′ said Jon Hill, rate strategist at BMO.
*****
> Hill said traders will be watching the three auctions, $38 billion in 3-year notes Tuesday; a record $27 billion 10-years Wednesday and the record $19 billion 30-year long bond auction, on Thursday.
*****
> Hill said the market will be watching ISM nonmanufacturing data Tuesday to see if the services side of the economy is still holding up. “It’s been a point of continued strength,” he said, noting at the same time manufacturing has been in decline.
*****
> Knapp said he is also worried that the dollar could strengthen on the trade war, and hurt emerging market currencies and U.S. profits. He noted that the Chinese currency weakened against the dollar overnight.
*****
> He said he is concerned currency volatility could “just start to have this big disruption that could be another factor that would just bleed into risk markets like the equity market.”

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 8/2/19

> Economic data may have taken a bit of a backseat amidst the FOMC meeting Wednesday and tariff headlines at the tail end of the week, but the US still had a heavy slate with 38 total releases.

> Data was broadly weaker with almost twice as many releases coming in weaker (20) than stronger (11) relative to forecasts (or the prior release when there was no consensus forecast). The Dallas Fed kicked off the week with a weaker than expected reading on manufacturing activity, but it was an improvement from June’s level of negative 12.1. In other manufacturing data, on Thursday we got Markit and ISM PMIs which were mixed. While Markit was stronger, the headline reading of ISM was weaker; new orders did improve, however. Headline factory orders were also weaker, but excluding transportation they were unchanged. As forecasted, personal income and spending weakened while inflation came in at a slower than expected pace on Tuesday. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence indices were the main bright spot of the week with stronger readings across the board. Claims data continued to show a slower pace of improvement on Thursday as both initial and continuing claims came in above expectations. Meanwhile, Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls report was the most inline with expectations since October 2012, coming in only 1K below forecasts of 165K.


> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-EcoT2.png))**

> Economic data is much lighter next week. The non-manufacturing portions of ISM and Markit PMIs are due on Monday. JOLTS and consumer credit are out on Wednesday. Producer inflation gauges are set to be released Friday.

# Fakeouts

> Throughout the course of the entire year, large caps have been leading the market higher, and they are the only market cap range of the equity market to actually make new highs in the most recent leg higher for equities. After this week's pullback, though, the S&P 500 is coming perilously close to breaking through support at the prior highs from April and last fall. A close below those levels today would not be a great mood-setter for the bulls heading into the weekend.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-SPX.png))**

> For Mid and Small Caps, the picture is even less optimistic. The S&P 400 Mid Cap index never came close to a new high in the most recent rally, but it did appear to break its downtrend from the highs late last year. But that breakout quickly turned to a fakeout this week as the S&P 400 broke back down below its prior downtrend line and is breaking below the 50-DMA today.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-MID.png))**

> For the small-cap Russell 2000, it's an identical picture. In this case, the break above the downtrend line was even more short-lived, and like the S&P 400, the Russell 2000 is not only back below its 50-DMA, but it also isn't that far from breaking below its 200-DMA.

# Earnings Season Déjà Vu

> Is it happening again? After what has to this point been a perfectly good earnings season for the US stock market sending the S&P 500 to new all-time highs in the process, the President spoiled the party yesterday when he tweeted that a new round of tariffs would be instituted on Chinese Imports. Stocks had erased all of their declines from Powell's Wednesday press conference by mid-day Thursday, but then the President’s tweet sent equity markets reeling with the Dow falling more than 1%, while the yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell back below 2%.

> If this whole scenario sounds familiar to you, that’s because we saw the same thing last quarter. Remember back in April when the S&P 500 rallied to new highs in the early weeks of earnings season? There was a feeling then that the market was finally breaking out of its rut and on the path to a sustained breakout. But then over the first weekend of May, on a Sunday afternoon no less, the President sent out a series of tweets outlining his plan for increased tariffs on Chinese imports. The following Monday, the market opened lower and kept falling throughout the month. By the end of May, the S&P 500 was down 6.6% for the month, making it the worst May for the S&P 500 since 2010. August has historically been an iffy month for the stock market as many on Wall Street take vacations and try to relax, but if the market follows the earnings season script from last quarter, this will be an August of little rest.

# President Takes Matters into His Own Hands

> The President has been frustrated with the Federal Reserve’s prior rate hikes and now the lack of a more substantial cut in rates. Just the other day, Trump was quoted as saying, “Obama had zero interest rates, we have ‘normalized’ rates. While the Fed hasn’t helped the President’s cause, he has seemingly taken matters into his own hands with his policy towards China. Each time he ratchets up the rhetoric against China, it tends to put additional downward pressure on interest rates, and following Thursday’s tweets, the yield on the 10-year plummetted below 1.9%.

> Ironically enough, the last time the 10-year yield was this low was on Election Day 2016. While short-term borrowing costs are up as the FOMC has hiked rates during Trump's time in office, the yield on the 10-year isn’t much different. Under the eight years of President Obama, the yield on the 10-year averaged 2.47%, while under Trump the average yield has been 2.57%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-10-Year-Yield.png))**

> The chart below shows a shorter-term look at the 10-year yield over the last year and it has practically been in free-fall the entire time. Ever since late 2018, every time the yield has attempted to make a move above its 50-DMA, it has reversed lower, with the most recent leg lower in May coinciding with another series of tweets concerning tariffs on Chinese goods.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080119-10YR-Yield.png))**

> While not a lot of stocks have benefitted from the President’s policy tweets on Chinese tariffs, the impact of lower interest rates has been cheered on by the homebuilders as they have practically been a completely inverse image of the move in rates. Just yesterday, the group hit a new high before pulling back a bit, but lower long-term interest rates mean lower mortgage payments, and that helps to make housing more affordable for millions of millennials looking for a place of their own.

# Outside Day for Gold (GLD)

> Even though assets have been selling off across the board in response to Wednesday's Fed decision and the President's announcement of increased tariffs yesterday, there is one bullish point to be found. Yesterday, gold (GLD) had initially moved slightly lower around the open but then surged into the close, finishing the day only a couple of cents off of the intraday high. Not only did GLD fully recoup the morning's losses, but it also gained back the previous day's losses and then some. This outside day/bullish engulfing pattern is typically seen as a bullish technical signal.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GLD.png))**

> This pattern has occurred a total of 35 times in the history of the Gold ETF (GLD). Below we show the 10 previous times that this pattern was observed after not having occurred in the previous six months. Despite being a bullish setup, performance in the next week has actually had a negative bias with an average return of -0.57%. The past five times have seen a loss in the following week. Likewise, three months out sees better than average returns but the probability of GLD trading higher is the just the same as a coinflip. But, generally, in the months and year after, GLD continues to trend higher on average with more consistent gains in the next month, 6 months, and year periods. Returns are also better than normal across these time frames.

# Solid Jobs Growth in July

> The job market continues to be a pillar of strength for the U.S. economy.

> Nonfarm payrolls rose 164,000 in July, in line with consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released August 2. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Solid Jobs Growth in July, job creation has slowed slightly this year amid the aging economic expansion, but not to levels that concern us. The 12-month average payrolls gain through July was 187,000, still an above-average pace for the expansion.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NSNykYz.png))**

> Strength in the job market is especially important these days as U.S. consumers increasingly bear the weight of economic growth. Consumer activity added 2.9 percentage points to second quarter gross domestic product (GDP), carrying GDP growth to 2.1%.

> Initial jobless claims, a leading economic indicator, have also pointed to firm labor-market conditions. The four-week average for unemployment claims fell to the fifth-lowest level of the expansion through July 26.

> “We’ve been encouraged by the labor market’s resiliency amid recent global uncertainty,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “A solid labor market should continue to bolster consumer confidence and buoy economic activity.”

> Average hourly earnings grew 3.2% year over year in July, a faster pace than June’s growth and at a healthy clip for the U.S. consumer. Wages constitute about 70% of business costs, so we’re hoping meaningful pay increases will eventually help lift consumer inflation, countering weakness in global demand. The unemployment rate climbed to 3.7%, still near a cycle low.

# August: Better in Pre-Election Years, But Still Not Great

> Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best month from 1901 to 1951. In 1900, 37.5% of the population was farming. Now that less than 2% farm, August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 31 years, 1988-2018 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.

> In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve modestly: #7 DJIA, #8 S&P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #9 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000 which is unchanged.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2c259751b53bc3c3005d4c266dd9fac/b4aa95c4256eed3a-ce/s400x600/345335a8152d24b9b10af91f813c9bf07af456fe.jpg))**

> Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011 and 2013 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline. A strong August in 2014 of S&P 3.8% and NASDAQ 4.8% preceded corrections of 7.4% and 8.4% respectively from mid-September to mid-October.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a fantastic weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets!",2019-08-02
cm6h45,39,51,investing,Thoughts on the state of the markets and stock watchlist for 8/5 - 8/12 trading week (LONG POST),0.85,1565009110.0,1564980310.0,"Hey y'all,

**APOLOGIES FOR THE LONG POST - If you're here just for the picks, scroll down and skip my scattered musings on the state of the markets for the week**

What a week for the stock market we just had! JPOW, earnings/guidance all over the place (I'm looking at you, $SQ, $ETSY), new tariffs on China. Unless we get significant news about a positive trade deal development we should expect the new week to be a great one for the bears - markets should lose (quite) a few points across the board, with the potential for a *significant drop* (we're talking SPY below 280 **very quickly,** if 285-287ish resistance doesn't hold) depending on the news that come ahead.

Even if the main indicators and most stonks come down, however, **we know that some will trend up**. There are promising potential venues for traders to make a profit across the aisle, and if you've followed my posts/watchlists for some time you know that I advocate for investing in individual stocks, and I think both bears and bulls can make a profit in these markets. With the trade war, we know that not all sectors will be affected equally, and if we learned anything from the previous round of tariffs in early May, we know that some sectors and some stocks are actually quite strong in times of trade war turmoil. Cybersecurity, software, health insurance, genetics, (some) medical devices, etc. proved pretty strong in the last round of cuts. And I personally expect cybersecurity, software, and much in the health care sector to climb up/correct in the weeks ahead.

With all this said, make sure you identify those strong stocks that are oversold and shouldn't be (so) affected by the new tariffs, and keep a close eye on those. If you think a strong company's stock has been unfairly hit by trade war news and no other significant news (ehem... CRWD, OKTA, ZS, NOW, MDB), then there's no reason why you should stop investing on that stock, especially if you're in for the long term.

If you're feeling overly bearish on the main indicators, keep in mind that a lot of the damage from the news we know (that the US will impose new tariffs on China, that the Chinese govt. is considering retaliation, etc.) will be priced in. By the time the markets open (expect a sharp drop in all main indicators then), we should see the gains of over two months totally wiped out... (in just a few days since FOMC+Tariff tweet, mind you). So if you're considering going all in on SPY puts (like a couple of you messaged me about!), reconsider. The optimal time to have done this was right after the tariff tweets or even holding puts over the weekend. Monday at market open might not be such a good idea - it'll all be contingent on what we hear from Trump/China on trade developments, and whatever way the news media spins that. Expect the coming week(s) to be all about China (just like early May was)... Though y'all already knew that.

Also keep in mind that we have (yet another) big round of earnings ahead of us (i.e. **$DIS**, **$ROKU**, **$TTD**, **$LYFT/UBER**, etc.), Xi's (hopefully lack of) retaliation, Trump's whimsical (to say the least) trade policy decisions/responses in the next week, and plenty of significant developments in the global economy to keep an eye out for (i.e. watch out for developments on Brexit and Boris Johnson \[my heart goes to my fellow Brits for such a joke of a PM\]; developments with Iran and in the Middle East as a whole; unrest in HK; currency wars, etc.). Plenty of news/potentials to turn the markets around. Also keep in mind that Buffett's Berkshire [is holding more cash than ever](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-03/buffett-s-cash-pile-hits-record-as-berkshire-holds-122-billion) (would love to hear your thoughts about this/its implications below!)

Here's a list of stocks to keep a watch on for bulls and bears, along with a very brief explanation on each:

**BULLISH:**

* **$CRM** is quite oversold, and the markets haven't really priced in the positive news with the **$BABA** partnership. There's an encouraging amount of buying in the 8/23 $150C, and we (**$CRM** traders/investors) know the company's tremendous potential and solid fundamentals. If feeling bullish at all this week, this is one to consider.
* **$CRWD** and **$OKTA**. These have come down sharply on no good reason, they are in an essential sector that grew in the last round of tariffs. Both are incredibly strong companies (**$CRWD** well ahead of **$OKTA** imo, and with much more potential to soar in the short term). **$CRWD** dropped on Friday on no volume. Monster growth company with VERY few stocks available for trading in a sector well positioned to grow during the trade wars. If bullish, **$CRWD** should be HIGH on your watchlist, **$OKTA** closely following. **$ZS** is also a strong entry, especially if going long (and willing to cash in on strong upcoming earnings!)
* Software/cloud and other tech companies such as **$NOW, $MDB, $SPLK,** **$TWLO (all alarmingly oversold)**, **$ADBE** (strongish close above 290, *very oversold*), **$TEAM** (Oppenheimer Tech Conference 8/6-8/7) and even popular tech companies like **$FB** and **$PINS. None of these** should be terribly hurt by new tariffs, have much potential from a technical standpoint, and are much smarter investments than companies in other sectors such as retail, construction, finances, etc. These stand to lose the least (and win the most, if any!) in the middle of the trade frenzy.
* Do not underestimate the positive Barron's mentions that **$LULU** and **$NKE** received, and consider that the stocks have gotten significant analyst upgrades in the last month or two. Good to keep high on your watchlists if you're a bull or considering entry on a strong retail stock

**BEARISH:**

* Most things, really... I wouldn't consider starting positions on retail right now. For those of you who trade options and are bearish, a lot of the cheddar is to be made here. Shorting stocks like $DLTR and $BBY should print tendies, and I do think there's lots of potential for your $WM and $COST to keep dropping quite a bit.
* Bearish on **$CAT**, **$DE**, **$MMM**
* Bearish on oil companies/oil across the board for next week
* SPY will come down hard if no good news (from China, especially) on the horizon

**EARNINGS PLAYS (I will post an explanation for these in my personal wall to declutter this post):**

* *BULLISH:* **$DIS (holding some calls, will be picking up a few more** ***right before earnings***\*\*) , $TTD, $STMP, $CRON\*\*
* *BEARISH:* **$MELI, $ROKU, $WYNN** (considering buying puts *right before earnings*)

LETS GET THE CHEDDAR, MIS AMIGOS.

Have a bountiful trading week

**\*\*\*Note: I changed the format of this week's post a little and tried to include a little more information on why those are high on my watchlist. This is not investment advise, as you know. For the negative posters - The main purpose for this post, as in the past, is to start a conversation about individual stocks and to encourage sharing ideas about strong stocks/stocks with more easily discernable patterns.** I know that many have benefited in the past, and I will continue to work on these in spite of the shade. Again, these picks are for you to research and to know well, before jumping in.

\*\*\***I'll be posting flash stock picks and thoughts on my reddit wall sporadically throughout the week. Make sure you keep an eye out for those!**",2019-08-02

# **Perfect summer storm brewing for stock correction as trade war simmers and more Fed action awaited  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/perfect-storm-building-for-market-correction.html)**
*****
> With new risks from trade wars, stocks head into the final weeks of summer vulnerable to a pull back or even correction.
*****
> The market was down sharply in the past week, buffeted first by disappointment over the Fed’s more hawkish-than-expected policy outlook. Then they were beaten down by fears President Donald Trump is starting a new front in the trade wars with China that is unlikely to end any time soon.
*****
> “The real issue as to why there’s going to be a correction in our view is there’s a massive, massive vacuum here,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivative strategy at BTIG. “In essence, it’s a month and a half of a vacuum, if you think about the direction of the rhetoric. ... The issues are China, the issues are the Fed and the issues are Brexit. In the first tow, you’re almost not going to hear anything.”
*****
> Trump, in threatening new tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods on Thursday, said the tariffs would go into effect on Sept. 1 unless China acts, but no new talks are expected before September. Economists said if the tariffs are put in place, the risks of a U.S. recession rise, particularly if businesses step back from investment, and possibly even hiring. But that could also prompt the Fed to cut interest rates to rescue the economy when it meets in September.
*****
> After a deluge of corporate headlines in the past several weeks, the earnings season is also winding down with just about 60 major companies reporting in the week ahead, and there are no really significant economic reports until the middle of the month.
*****
> Emanuel said the S&P 500 could see a decline to about 2,789, though he still expects to see 3,000 at the end of the year. Stocks started the past week near all-time highs, and the S&P 500 was was down more than 3% in the past week, but still up about 17% for the year-to-date. Odds are high that stocks pull back in August, since for the past eight years, the S&P 500 was negative during August in six of them.
*****
> Emanuel said if stocks decline too much or too long, he expects to see some action from the White House that will halt the selling.
*****
> “If you’re the president, there’s no way you’re going to allow an economic slowdown in an election year,” said Emanuel.
*****
> Barry Knapp, managing partner at Ironsides Macroeconomics, said Friday the escalation of the trade wars has made him more risk adverse, and he would lighten up holdings in the sectors he had favored—industrials, technology and transportation stocks.
*****
> “We could have a correction ... then we’ll have to see how the policy makers respond to it,′ Knapp said. “The risks are significant. I think we’ll get a correction. ... We could trade back to the May lows, somewhere around 2,750. then we’ll see how the administration responds. This was a seasonally vulnerable period.”
*****
> The Fed cut its target fed funds rate range Wednesday for the first time in a decade, but it does not have another meeting until Sept. 17, though Fed official hold their annual symposium in Jackson Hole at the end of August.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell disappointed markets when he said the Fed was in a “midcycle adjustment,” not a longer term rate cutting cycle but by Friday, futures markets were indicating a nearly 100% chance the Fed will cut interest rates in September.
*****
> “Clearly from the Fed, you’re going to get silence, until the end of the month in Jackson Hole where you may hear something but nothing of materiality,” said Emanuel. “All the Chinese leadership is by the seaside for the next couple of weeks...what you’re going to get for the next two weeks is next to total silence.”
*****
> Emanuel said Brexit is also a risk for markets, as the U.K. gets closer to the Oct. 31 deadline to leave the European Union. “In all likelihood, if you hear something between now and then, it’s basically going to increase the perception that brinkmanship toward the Oct. 31 deadline becomes more a reality every day, and this is reflected in the fact the British sterling is collapsing,” he said. The market has been speculating that the odds of a hard Brexit are increasing, meaning Britain leaves the EU with no plan.
*****
> Interest rates and currency wars
> Currency markets were volatile in the past week, but the dollar index was basically flat by Friday afternoon. Traders were monitoring both the moves in the foreign exchange market and fixed income markets.
*****
> As for the bond market, the declines in yields in the past week were dramatic, with about a 30 basis point move in the 10-year yield in just two days. Treasury yields were bouncing along 2016 levels. The 10-year moved from about 2.07% ahead of the Fed news to less than 1.85% It was at 1.87% Friday afternoon.
*****
> Yields, which move opposite price, also had moved lower on the Trump trade threats.
*****
> “Now everybody is waiting for the next tweet. Unfortunately, there’s no economics calendar for when those come out,′ said Jon Hill, rate strategist at BMO.
*****
> Hill said traders will be watching the three auctions, $38 billion in 3-year notes Tuesday; a record $27 billion 10-years Wednesday and the record $19 billion 30-year long bond auction, on Thursday.
*****
> Hill said the market will be watching ISM nonmanufacturing data Tuesday to see if the services side of the economy is still holding up. “It’s been a point of continued strength,” he said, noting at the same time manufacturing has been in decline.
*****
> Knapp said he is also worried that the dollar could strengthen on the trade war, and hurt emerging market currencies and U.S. profits. He noted that the Chinese currency weakened against the dollar overnight.
*****
> He said he is concerned currency volatility could “just start to have this big disruption that could be another factor that would just bleed into risk markets like the equity market.”

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 8/2/19

> Economic data may have taken a bit of a backseat amidst the FOMC meeting Wednesday and tariff headlines at the tail end of the week, but the US still had a heavy slate with 38 total releases.

> Data was broadly weaker with almost twice as many releases coming in weaker (20) than stronger (11) relative to forecasts (or the prior release when there was no consensus forecast). The Dallas Fed kicked off the week with a weaker than expected reading on manufacturing activity, but it was an improvement from June’s level of negative 12.1. In other manufacturing data, on Thursday we got Markit and ISM PMIs which were mixed. While Markit was stronger, the headline reading of ISM was weaker; new orders did improve, however. Headline factory orders were also weaker, but excluding transportation they were unchanged. As forecasted, personal income and spending weakened while inflation came in at a slower than expected pace on Tuesday. The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence indices were the main bright spot of the week with stronger readings across the board. Claims data continued to show a slower pace of improvement on Thursday as both initial and continuing claims came in above expectations. Meanwhile, Friday’s Nonfarm Payrolls report was the most inline with expectations since October 2012, coming in only 1K below forecasts of 165K.


> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-EcoT2.png))**

> Economic data is much lighter next week. The non-manufacturing portions of ISM and Markit PMIs are due on Monday. JOLTS and consumer credit are out on Wednesday. Producer inflation gauges are set to be released Friday.

# Fakeouts

> Throughout the course of the entire year, large caps have been leading the market higher, and they are the only market cap range of the equity market to actually make new highs in the most recent leg higher for equities. After this week's pullback, though, the S&P 500 is coming perilously close to breaking through support at the prior highs from April and last fall. A close below those levels today would not be a great mood-setter for the bulls heading into the weekend.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-SPX.png))**

> For Mid and Small Caps, the picture is even less optimistic. The S&P 400 Mid Cap index never came close to a new high in the most recent rally, but it did appear to break its downtrend from the highs late last year. But that breakout quickly turned to a fakeout this week as the S&P 400 broke back down below its prior downtrend line and is breaking below the 50-DMA today.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-MID.png))**

> For the small-cap Russell 2000, it's an identical picture. In this case, the break above the downtrend line was even more short-lived, and like the S&P 400, the Russell 2000 is not only back below its 50-DMA, but it also isn't that far from breaking below its 200-DMA.

# Earnings Season Déjà Vu

> Is it happening again? After what has to this point been a perfectly good earnings season for the US stock market sending the S&P 500 to new all-time highs in the process, the President spoiled the party yesterday when he tweeted that a new round of tariffs would be instituted on Chinese Imports. Stocks had erased all of their declines from Powell's Wednesday press conference by mid-day Thursday, but then the President’s tweet sent equity markets reeling with the Dow falling more than 1%, while the yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell back below 2%.

> If this whole scenario sounds familiar to you, that’s because we saw the same thing last quarter. Remember back in April when the S&P 500 rallied to new highs in the early weeks of earnings season? There was a feeling then that the market was finally breaking out of its rut and on the path to a sustained breakout. But then over the first weekend of May, on a Sunday afternoon no less, the President sent out a series of tweets outlining his plan for increased tariffs on Chinese imports. The following Monday, the market opened lower and kept falling throughout the month. By the end of May, the S&P 500 was down 6.6% for the month, making it the worst May for the S&P 500 since 2010. August has historically been an iffy month for the stock market as many on Wall Street take vacations and try to relax, but if the market follows the earnings season script from last quarter, this will be an August of little rest.

# President Takes Matters into His Own Hands

> The President has been frustrated with the Federal Reserve’s prior rate hikes and now the lack of a more substantial cut in rates. Just the other day, Trump was quoted as saying, “Obama had zero interest rates, we have ‘normalized’ rates. While the Fed hasn’t helped the President’s cause, he has seemingly taken matters into his own hands with his policy towards China. Each time he ratchets up the rhetoric against China, it tends to put additional downward pressure on interest rates, and following Thursday’s tweets, the yield on the 10-year plummetted below 1.9%.

> Ironically enough, the last time the 10-year yield was this low was on Election Day 2016. While short-term borrowing costs are up as the FOMC has hiked rates during Trump's time in office, the yield on the 10-year isn’t much different. Under the eight years of President Obama, the yield on the 10-year averaged 2.47%, while under Trump the average yield has been 2.57%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080219-10-Year-Yield.png))**

> The chart below shows a shorter-term look at the 10-year yield over the last year and it has practically been in free-fall the entire time. Ever since late 2018, every time the yield has attempted to make a move above its 50-DMA, it has reversed lower, with the most recent leg lower in May coinciding with another series of tweets concerning tariffs on Chinese goods.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/080119-10YR-Yield.png))**

> While not a lot of stocks have benefitted from the President’s policy tweets on Chinese tariffs, the impact of lower interest rates has been cheered on by the homebuilders as they have practically been a completely inverse image of the move in rates. Just yesterday, the group hit a new high before pulling back a bit, but lower long-term interest rates mean lower mortgage payments, and that helps to make housing more affordable for millions of millennials looking for a place of their own.

# Outside Day for Gold (GLD)

> Even though assets have been selling off across the board in response to Wednesday's Fed decision and the President's announcement of increased tariffs yesterday, there is one bullish point to be found. Yesterday, gold (GLD) had initially moved slightly lower around the open but then surged into the close, finishing the day only a couple of cents off of the intraday high. Not only did GLD fully recoup the morning's losses, but it also gained back the previous day's losses and then some. This outside day/bullish engulfing pattern is typically seen as a bullish technical signal.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GLD.png))**

> This pattern has occurred a total of 35 times in the history of the Gold ETF (GLD). Below we show the 10 previous times that this pattern was observed after not having occurred in the previous six months. Despite being a bullish setup, performance in the next week has actually had a negative bias with an average return of -0.57%. The past five times have seen a loss in the following week. Likewise, three months out sees better than average returns but the probability of GLD trading higher is the just the same as a coinflip. But, generally, in the months and year after, GLD continues to trend higher on average with more consistent gains in the next month, 6 months, and year periods. Returns are also better than normal across these time frames.

# Solid Jobs Growth in July

> The job market continues to be a pillar of strength for the U.S. economy.

> Nonfarm payrolls rose 164,000 in July, in line with consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released August 2. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Solid Jobs Growth in July, job creation has slowed slightly this year amid the aging economic expansion, but not to levels that concern us. The 12-month average payrolls gain through July was 187,000, still an above-average pace for the expansion.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NSNykYz.png))**

> Strength in the job market is especially important these days as U.S. consumers increasingly bear the weight of economic growth. Consumer activity added 2.9 percentage points to second quarter gross domestic product (GDP), carrying GDP growth to 2.1%.

> Initial jobless claims, a leading economic indicator, have also pointed to firm labor-market conditions. The four-week average for unemployment claims fell to the fifth-lowest level of the expansion through July 26.

> “We’ve been encouraged by the labor market’s resiliency amid recent global uncertainty,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “A solid labor market should continue to bolster consumer confidence and buoy economic activity.”

> Average hourly earnings grew 3.2% year over year in July, a faster pace than June’s growth and at a healthy clip for the U.S. consumer. Wages constitute about 70% of business costs, so we’re hoping meaningful pay increases will eventually help lift consumer inflation, countering weakness in global demand. The unemployment rate climbed to 3.7%, still near a cycle low.

# August: Better in Pre-Election Years, But Still Not Great

> Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best month from 1901 to 1951. In 1900, 37.5% of the population was farming. Now that less than 2% farm, August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 31 years, 1988-2018 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.

> In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve modestly: #7 DJIA, #8 S&P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #9 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000 which is unchanged.

> Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011 and 2013 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline. A strong August in 2014 of S&P 3.8% and NASDAQ 4.8% preceded corrections of 7.4% and 8.4% respectively from mid-September to mid-October.

The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

30 million accounts watching 3.5 hours of TV per day... this is like 210 million accounts with FB-level engagement. OK? BIG engagement. And growing. Owning the customer relationship to the TV, what could possibly be more valuable than this? Not even Facebook have this. Not even Google or Apple have something this powerful. (To be clear, this is a forward looking statement. I disclaim all obligations to update forward looking statements under the safe harbor provison yada yada yada)

ROKU demolishing competition in terms of devices sold and streaming viewing hours... oh, you thought Amazon Fire would crush ROKU? Smart thought, but now that this did not happen and will not happen(refer to ROKU shareholder letter, other sources showing increasingly growing lead, please talk to boomer suburban white ladies over cup of chamomile), perception of value should go way fucking up.

By the way management is just top notch... They have the interest of customer and content provider in mind, and strategic placement as well. Mr. Wood genuinely is a top-tier CEO.

#International

Anthony Wood was very coy on the call when asked about interntational. I love this coyness and it only makes me hard. ROKU has big plans for international, it is a vast opportunity. Refer to NFLX stock performance since entering the international market. There is no reason why ROKU will not own this market too.


#Virtuous cycles/Network effects

So, so many. It's beautiful. 

ROKU channel -- Moar engagement -> Moar ad revenue -> Moar content providers place content on service -> Moar engagement

(this also exist for individual channels ecosystem on ROKU)

Simple right? Here's another

ROKU OS builds brand & customer demand -> OEM want to partner with ROKU ->  Moar make and models available for TV -> Moar customer adoption & brand -> Moar OEM

Yeah you like that you little bitch? Here is another network effect:

Moar users -> More money -> Make better OS ->Moar users

Oh yeah did I mention the explosive fucking growth across active accounts and ARPU? I guess take a note of that.

Look guys, this stock is at its most undervalued so far. While it is at highest price so far, the biggest barrier to a $1,000 stock price, fears of competition, should be essentially removed at this point.

**Today’s Bullish Activity**

Leading the point gainers list this morning is **Deciphera Pharmaceuticals Inc. (DCPH + $19.30 to $39.25)** after the drug developer said that its lead drug (ripretinib) achieved the main goal of preventing cancer from progressing in patients with a form of stomach cancer (gastrointestinal stromal tumors) in an updated Phase 1 study. Results from the study showed that patients treated with ripretinib had a progression-free survival rate of 6.3 months compared with 1 month in placebo cases. The company said that the data supports an ongoing intrigue Phase 3 clinical study in patients with second-line gist. Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 5:2 which is primarily being driven by activity on the August 16th 25.00 put (volume is 1,540).   

Also trading to the upside is **JD.com Inc. (JD + $2.87 to $30.03)** after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported Q2 earnings of RMB 2.30 per share, excluding non-recurring items (RMB 1.76 better than the RMB 0.54 expected) on revenue that increased 22.9% year-over-year to RMB 150.28B (above the RMB 147.44B consensus estimate). Annual active customer accounts increased to 321.3M from 310.5M quarter-over-quarter. Looking ahead, the company said it expects Q3 revenue to come in a range of RMB 126-130B versus the RMB 126.13B consensus estimate. Shares of JD are trading above the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $29.27 at the time of this writing. Call volume is dominating (\~4:1 over puts w/all of the top 10 contracts being a call) with the August 16th 31.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 0,494).  

Lastly, shares of **McDonald’s Inc. (MCD + $2.19 to $219.35)** are trading higher after MKM Partners initiated coverage on the fast food chain with a “Buy” rating and $250.00 price target, citing strong sales growth, cash flow and solid same-store sales generation. Calls are outpacing puts roughly 5:2 with the August 16th 222.50 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 1,114).

New 52-week highs (59 new highs today): **Amgen Inc. (AMGN + $2.96 to $208.74), Five9 Inc. (FIVN + $2.10 to $63.39), Roku Inc. (ROKU + $4.54 to $138.84), AT&T Inc. (T + $0.30 to $34.79)**

**Notable Call Activity**

Some unusual call activity (\~11:1 over puts) is being seen in the **iShares Silver Trust ETF (SLV - $0.07 to $15.91)** as all of the top 10 most actively traded contracts. The most actively traded contract is the September 20th 16.00 call as volume is 42,594 (vs. open interest of 120,260). The majority of the transactions on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at the ask price of $0.46.

**Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC + $1.24 to $47.59):** Calls are outpacing puts roughly 25:1 as option traders primarily target the October 18th 60.00 call. Volume on this contract is 9,327 (vs. open interest of 23,464) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at the ask price of $0.25. From a technical perspective, shares of MPC appear to be staging a bounce from an area where the stock bounced back in late May (today’s low = $45.64, May 31st low = $45.47).

**Today’s Bearish Activity** 

Multiple stocks are moving lower following disappointing earnings/guidance:

* **Advanced Auto Parts Inc. (AAP - $2.09 to $140.07):** The auto parts retailer reported Q2 earnings of $2.00 per share ($0.21 miss) on revenue that rose 0.2% year-over-year to $2.33B (below the $2.30B expected) as comparable same-store sales were flat year-over-year. The company issued downside guidance as full-year 2019 revenue is expected to come in a range of $9.65-9.75B (below the $9.76B expected) and lowered comparable same-store sales guidance to +1.0-2.0% from +1.0-2.5%. Shares of AAP hit a low of $130.09 near the open this morning but have recovered substantially off that level at the time of this writing. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 4:3 with the August 16th 145.00 call garnering the most attention from traders (volume is 3,179).
* **Bloom Energy Corp. (BE - $2.80 to $5.20):** The clean-energy company reported a Q2 loss of $0.13 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.06 beat) on revenue that rose 38.4% year-over-year to $233.8M (above the $207.56M expected) as acceptances were 271 (vs. 250-280 guidance). Looking ahead, the company said it expects Q3 acceptances to be 280-310 with average selling price to come in a range of $6,300-6,600. Puts are outnumbering calls better than 2:1 with the November 15th 6.00 put topping the most actives list (volume is 1,003).
* **Covetrus Inc. (CVET - $9.88 to $13.31):** The provider of animal-health technology and services reported Q2 adjusted earnings of $0.13 per share ($0.03 miss) on net sales of $1.01B (flat year-over-year and in-line with estimates). The company lowered guidance as adjusted EBITDA is expected to be “at least $200M” (vs. prior expectations of $235-250M) and said it expects organic net sales growth to come in the “low single digits” (vs. a prior forecast of +3-5%). Shares of CVET are trading at all-time lows this morning. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 2:1 with the January 2021 22.50 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 110).

New 52-week lows (185 new lows today): **Alcoa Corp. (AA + $0.79 to $19.31), Baidu Inc. (BIDU + $3.32 to $98.40), F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV + $2.59 to $133.07), Signet Jewelers Ltd. (SIG + $0.86 to $13.95), United States Steel Corp. (X + $0.59 to $12.20)**

**Notable Put Activity**

Some unusual put activity (\~39:1 over calls) is being seen in the **SPDR S&P Regional Bank ETF (KRE + $0.79 to $50.94)** as all of the top 10 most actively traded contracts are puts. However, not all of the activity appears to be bearish in nature. The most actively traded contract is the January 2020 41.00 put (volume is 5,164 vs. open interest of 345) which mostly consisted of various sized blocks that were being sold at the bid price of $0.70. The activity suggests that the put sellers either believe that KRE will close at or above $41.00 (in which the premium received will be kept) or are comfortable taking a long position in the ETF at an effective purchase price of $40.30 in the even that KRE closes below $41.00 at expiration.

**Volume Signals** 

**Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ + $0.38 to $54.63):** Option volume is running at over 10x the daily average of 1,062 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 20th 57.50 call. Volume on this contract is 12,108 (vs. open interest of 4,849) which included a 5,478 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.40. We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.

**PG&E Corp. (PCG + $0.21 to $16.97):** Option volume is running at roughly 3.5x the daily average of 10,521 contracts which is primarily being driven by a 30K block that was bought on the August 30th 19.00 call at the ask price of $0.85 (open interest of 153). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.

**Newmont Goldcorp (NEM - $0.78 to $37.68):** Option volume is running at roughly 4x the daily average of 7,958 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the August 23rd 37.00 put. Volume on this contract is 35,575 (vs. open interest of 92) which most consisted of various sized blocks that were being sold for between $0.57-0.60. The activity suggests that the put sellers either believe that NEM will close at or above $37.00 (in which the premium received will be kept) or are comfortable taking a long position in the stock in the event that NEM closes below $37.00 at expiration.

**Gauging Volatility**

The **CBOE Volatility Index (VIX - 3.41 to 17.68)** has been on both sides of the unchanged line today (intraday range is 17.68-21.64) as equity markets are firmly higher across the board around the mid-day mark today (DJI + 440, SPX + 50, COMPX + 161). VIX option volume has been above average today at 568,514 contracts (#3 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.24). The most actively traded contract is the August 21st 18.00 call as volume is 55,788 versus open interest of 194,191.",2019-08-13
ctmef9,33,16,wallstreetbets,BBY calls,0.84,1566447435.0,1566418635.0,"After I horribly messed up and lost a lot of money with home depot, I was thinking about putting puts on BBY.

Then I realized that pretty much everything to do with BBY and its whole industry is up.

Every single retail store giant seems to be booming exceptionally well in their earnings.

So, BBY calls.  Just because everything seems to have done well and I cannot see how BBY would be the exception.

I'll be buying them nice and early at a $75 strike.

Good luck.  Technically this is DD, since the financial statements of Walmart, Home Depot, Lowes, Roku, Nvidia, DI, TGT and more did well.

I figure if roku did well, it means TV sales are up significantly.  If Nvidia is up, computer sales are up.

Best buy is basically a computer/TV salesman with a bunch of overpriced shit that people still buy.

TLDR:  BBY CALLS @ $75 - Pick your own expiration you animal.  


Edit:  Also, the recent drop of 8% was just because of tariff man tweets.  Since that's not an issue at the moment, should surge a lot higher a lot faster on a good earnings report.",2019-08-21

**Today’s Bullish Activity**

Shares of Dow-component **Johnson & Johnson Inc. (JNJ + $2.30 to $130.10)** are gapping up following news that an Oklahoma judge ruled that the healthcare giant must pay $572M for its part in fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic. The stock is moving higher as the fine was significantly lower than the $17B the Oklahoma Attorney General had been seeking to help pay for addiction treatment and prevention programs. Evercore ISI said fine expectations were between $500M and $5B with the consensus estimate around $1B. Puts are outnumbering calls nearly 2:1 with the September 20th 130.00 put being the most actively traded contract (volume is 6,774).

Also trading to the upside is **Caleres Inc. (CAL + $3.84 to $19.08)** after the footwear maker reported Q2 earnings of $0.62 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.04 beat) on revenue that increased 6.5% year-over-year to $752.5M (roughly in-line with the $752.2M consensus estimate). Brand portfolio sales increased 17.9% year-over-year to $359.6M while total Famous Footwear sales were $419.8M on same-store sales that increased 1.5%. Call volume is dominating (\~7:1 over puts) which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 20th 15.00 call (volume is 3,115).

Lastly, **Altria Group Inc. (MO + $3.99 to $51.11)** is moving higher on news that the company is in discussions with **Phillip Morris International Inc. (PM - $4.44 to $73.29)**regarding a potential all-stock merger of equals. MO calls are outnumbering puts roughly 5:3 with the September 20th 50.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 9,090). PM puts are outnumbering calls better than 2:1 with the September 20th 75.00 put seeing the most action from traders (volume is 3,983). PM average implied volatility is up to a year-to-date high of 36% this morning. *Note: the average implied volatility represents an estimated value for a 30-day implied volatility at the current underlying price, based on a curve fit of option implied volatilities.* 

New 52-week highs (39 new highs today): **Agree Realty Corp. (ADC + $0.55 to $73.85),** **Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM + $0.44 to $62.60), Idacorp Corp. (IDA + $0.70 to $109.71), Roku Inc. (ROKU + $2.59 to $145.60)**

**Notable Call Activity**

Some unusual call activity (\~50:1 over puts) is coming up on the radar on **Cloudera Inc. (CLDR + $0.02 to $8.85)** which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 20th 7.50 call. Volume on this contract is 9,966 (vs. open interest of 13,376) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times for between $0.48 and $0.50 each.

**Yelp Inc. (YELP + $0.65 to $32.68):** Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 20:1 as option traders primarily target two contracts that expire at the end of this week (August 30th):

* 33.00 call (volume is 7,885 vs. open interest of 125): Transactions on this contract mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times for $0.56.
* 32.50 call (volume is 3,588 vs. open interest of 56): Transactions on this contract mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times for between $0.71-0.86.

We know that the volume on both of these contracts represents new positioning based on the open interest figures and the bulk of the activity appears to be bullish in nature.

**Today’s Bearish Activity** 

Moving lower this morning is **J.M. Smucker Co. (SJM - $10.17 to $102.76)** after the branded pet, consumer foods and coffee company reported fiscal Q1 earnings of $1.57 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.18 miss) on revenue that fell 6.5% year-over-year to $1.78B (below the $1.88B expected). Commenting on the quarter, CEO Mark Smucker stated, “Our first quarter performance fell short of expectations primarily due to the timing of shipments and deflationary pricing in the coffee and peanut butter categories, as well as competitive activity in the premium dog food category”. Additionally, the company lowered full-year 2020 EPS guidance to $8.35-8.55 (from $8.45-8.65) on revenue that is expected to be “down 1% to flat” (from a prior view of “up more than 2%”). Puts are outnumbering calls nearly 2:1 with the September 20th 100.00 put topping the most actives list (volume is 1,307). 

Also trading to the downside is **Anaplan Inc. (PLAN - $2.86 to $56.49)** even though the maker of cloud-based planning software beat quarterly estimates and provided upbeat guidance earlier this morning. Anaplan reported a Q2 loss of $0.12 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.04 beat) on revenue that increased 46.2% year-over-year to $84.5M (above the $78.25M). Looking ahead, the company guided Q3 revenue to a range of $85.5-86.5M (vs. the $83.49M consensus estimate) and raised full-year 2020 revenue guidance to a range of $339-343M (from $326-331M). Calls are outnumbering puts better than 2:1 with the September 20th 60.00 call garnering the most attention from traders (volume is 1,289).

New 52-week lows (274 new lows today): **American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL - $0.16 to $25.03), Credicorp Ltd. (BAP + $1.44 to $202.22), Footlocker Inc. (FL - $0.34 to $35.35), Halliburton Co. (HAL + $0.18 to $17.68), Macy’s Inc. (M - $0.05 to $14.66)**

**Notable Put Activity**

Some unusual put activity (nearly 4:1 over calls) is being seen in **Hewlett Packard Enterprises Inc. (HPE + $0.04 to $12.98)** which is primarily being driven by activity on the August 30th 12.50 put. Volume on this contract is 15,566 (vs. open interest of 1,151), which nearly entirely consisted of a 15K block that was bought at the ask price of $0.18. We know this block is a new position based on the open interest figure and we can assume that the intent is bearish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.

**Volume Signals** 

Shares of the **iShares Silver Trust ETF (SLV + $0.42 to $16.94)** are pushing up to a nearly a two-year high this morning and six out of the top ten most actively traded option contracts across the market today are coming from this ETF. The top two most actively traded option contracts across the board today are the SLV October 18th 17.00 call (volume is 62,171 vs. open interest of 83,674) and the SLV January 2020 16.00 call (volume is 49,211 vs. open interest of 123,876).

**Chubb Ltd. (CB + $0.35 to $155.56):** Option volume is running at over 20x the daily average of 144 contracts which is primarily being driven by a couple of blocks that simultaneously traded on the September 20th expiration:

* 150.00 put – a 1,000 block traded for $1.40, directly in the middle of the $1.35 x $1.45 bid/ask spread (open interest of 210)
* 140.00 put – a 1,000 block was sold for $0.35 (open interest of 49)

We know these blocks are new positions and it appears that a $10.00-wide bear put spread was established for a net debit of $1.05 which suggests that the block trader believes that CB will close below the break-even price of $148.95 at expiration.

**Planet Fitness Inc. (PLNT + $1.12 to $69.49):** Option volume is running at over 5.5x the daily average of 904 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 20th 70.00 call. Volume on this contract is 3,160 (vs. open interest of 1,858) which mostly consisted of various sized blocks that were being bought for between $1.85-2.00, including a 1,064 block that was bought at the ask price of $1.85. Shares of PLNT have been in a downtrend for most of August but are exhibiting some relative strength today and appear to have found some technical support at the 200-day SMA over the past week.

**Gauging Volatility**

The **CBOE Volatility Index (VIX + 0.44 to 19.76)** has been on both sides of the unchanged line this morning (intraday range is 18.49-20.35) as equity markets are mixed around the mid-day mark today (DJI + 7, SPX + 2, COMPX - 3). VIX option volume has been below average today at 209,991 contracts (#5 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.44). The most actively traded contract is the September 18th 21.00 call as volume is 40,615 versus open interest of 154,710.",2019-08-27

czckvr,120,101,wallstreetbets,Free earnings tends: Cloudera ($CLDR) -- DD Inside,0.95,1567581604.0,1567552804.0,"**About the stock:**

Cloudera specializes in creating solutions for companies to manage large amounts of data and apply machine learning models to said data. TL/DR: Software made for retarded business analysts who have no clue wtf data science is or how it works but know how to click buttons on a computer.

**Valuation:**

Since IPO in 2017 (at $18) the stock has ranged between $23 and $5 and is now sitting at a fairly attractive price of $7.20 ($1.97B cap). Growth slowed down and investors fled after a shitty merger with Hortonworks, but they've since been trying to turn the company around. Last quarter they posted revenue of $187M which represented an 81% y/y growth. For the retards in the back, this means they posted close to the revenue of $ROKU last quarter ($250M) at an even better growth rate (81% vs. 59%) for 1/9 the valuation. 

Looking at forward revenue, they guided for $180-183M for this upcoming quarterly earnings; I'm hoping for a solid beat of around $190M. So if we extrapolate a bit, they could see 4-quarter forward revenue (assuming steady growth) of close to $1 billion, which would translate to \~2 P/S -- when compared to other software stocks that's peanuts.

**Catalysts:**

They recently announced a new platform called Cloudera Data Platform (CDP for short) which aims to take their entire business to the cloud and operate solely on subscriptions, as opposed to the in-person custom solutions they provide now. This \*should\* accelerate growth even more and bring in those juicy subscription based revenues that every wall st. analyst gets off to.

**Some other things:**

Carl Icahn, activist investor who bought into $NFLX at $10, recently became involved with the company this summer; he bought up 20% of the shares and installed 2 of his henchmen to the board of Cloudera. This man means business and he won't take losses for an answer, even if it means calling up Trump and having him pump the damn thing on twitter.

**Acquisition:**

In June, Cloudera and IBM announced a ""strategic partnership"". This comes after IBM had a juicy relationship with Hortonworks, the company that Cloudera merged with. IBM would be a top contender for buying out $CLDR at a fat premium -- they just acquired RedHat for like $30 billion so $2-3 billion would be nothing to them. I've read that Icahn has been encouraging a buyout as well, and I'd guess Cloudera would go for at $12-15/share.

&#x200B;

**Final thoughts:**

Options are still pretty cheap -- there's about a 14% implied move but the stock has seen huge 40% moves after earnings. At a $2B valuation, this seems like a no-brainer. Loaded up on 9/20 $7.50 calls today, and earnings are AH on 9/4.

During September, S&P was +1.2%, Dow +1.6%, and Nasdaq -0.3%, with notable events including tariff escalations, the Chinese delegation cancelling a planned visit to US farms, the recent attacks on Saudi oil facilities (triggering the largest one-day gain in oil prices in more than a decade), and the NY Fed's repo operations to provide liquidity and tamp down interest rates. The Fed also lowered interest rates by 25 bps during the month, the second rate cut in the last two months.

During the month, TDA clients were net buyers of:

* WORK, in spite of missing earnings
* DIS, which received an analyst upgrade and price target hike
* UBER, which was popular at the Delivering Alpha Conference
* ABBV, as it fell to a 52-week low and received an optimistic analyst upgrade
* ROKU, as it climbed to an over 400% YTD gain then fell after Apple's TV streaming announcement
* SHOP
* MO
* ULTA

TDA clients were net sellers of:

* AAPL, which announced a streaming TV service but approached an 11-month high
* FB, as the US Senate announced Big Tech antitrust hearings
* BABA, as news broke that the US could delist Chinese companies
* NFLX, after the CEO discussed tough competition from AAPL and DIS
* MU, as it missed on earnings
* INTC, in spite of a company statement signaling optimism regarding cloud spending
* NVDA
* BA
* GOOG

-----

What is the TDA IMX?

*A monthly bull-bear indicator that can provide an idea of market sentiment and equities exposure among retail traders. Higher scores indicate bullishness, whereas lower scores represent bearishness. Note that (obviously) it only uses data from TDA client accounts, and also isn't dollar-weighted. [Read more here.](https://www.tdameritrade.com/research/imx.page)*

Roku - Integration of Apple TV is a great addition to compete with Amazon Video, Netflix, and Disney. Roku on it's own is a cat - never dies, always recovers, and always makes you shake your head when you miss out on the pumps. Historically, if you look at ROKU, big green days generally run for about 3 days before it subsides and another pump follows.

AMD - They have earnings coming up soon. Last ER, both Lisa and Devinder were confident on positive cash flow. With the new lineup that was released this year, the numbers should look nice. Especially with holiday seasons coming, the next quarter will be even more exciting for those holding far out calls.

PCG - Well, they are in a shithole. But, the company has everything under control. I hear people talking about bankruptcy without understanding the function of it and how common it is for a company to do this. PCG is fundamentally okay. Gov. Newsom wanted to list the company for buyout and PCG refused the offer, arguing that they will be cover by year's end.

BYND - This overly pumped fake meat company should have been dead at the start of its IPO. -23% bleed in the last month looks great for the bear. This bearish sentiment will continue to drive the stock downhill with increased competition. BYND has no novelty or special product whatsoever => competition is not a good thing for them.

### Summary

We believe that Disney entering the DTC market was the right move for the following reasons. They have invested huge amounts into the tech platform (BAMTech) to enable this kind of service. They have one of the strongest brand names in media and entertainment as well that they are the leading content provider on the planet. Their studio productions will be able to serve two fold as blockbuster hits and then down the road adding to their streaming service. It only makes sense for them to dominate the growing DTC media/entertainment market.

However, the DTC market is becoming saturated with strong competitors including: Amazon Prime Video, Roku, Netflix, and now the entrants of Disney+ and the recently announced AppleTV+. We see this competition as a double-edged sword in the sense that there is the potential to grab revenues and market-share with the willingness of big companies to take some of the pie (powerful companies want to enter this market because it makes sense to), but also that more elite entrants into this already cut-throat industry is no easy task. What will separate one company from the rest will be their ability to provide quality content, which Disney has positioned themselves to do.

We believe that Disney will be sensitive to outside economic pressures that might affect their cash flow. Revenues from the Media Networks segment (and largest portion of revenues) of their business has been on the decline over recent years, but has been off-set by higher revenues from Parks and Resorts and Studio Entertainment. Should any of their other segments come short of providing support, their cash flow will take a hit.

The introduction of Disney+ will barely make a dent in their net revenues over the next 4-5 years. Potential growth and valuation will be highly dependent on subscriber count, but with Disneys current state of the brand and franchises they have put themselves in a great position to compete with their largest competitor, Netflix. With quality content coming from each of their studios (Marvel, Pixar, StarWars, and National Geographic, to name a few) they will have a strong line-up going into this launch.

### Final Thoughts

Disney is entering a highly competitive market, but we believe they have the right tools to succeed.

**1.** Theyve already successfully tested out the tech to launch DTC services (BAMTech - 4.9B in expenditures by FY 2020).  
**2.** Their already successful content outlets will provide a great value to their service.  
**3.** Competition, such as Netflix and AppleTV+, will be spending billions on content without a proven track-record. This is a risk for them and not so much for Disney since Disney already has a great pipeline of many quality IP.  
**4.** In terms of pricing, we see many similarities between all DTC content providers and the key factor that will separate one company from the other will be in content, which we believe Disney will provide and excel at.  
**5.** Disneys stock price has already jumped over 30% from the initial announcement of Disney+, but we think this new range will serve as a benchmark and good support.  
**6.** Disney isnt expected to report blowout subscriber count on the launch of their service, but we foresee they have the possibility to do so.  


**Positive Outlook Model:**  
\*Current revenue segments continue to grow at 18% Y.O.Y (quality studio releases, leveraging of brands to park themes, etc).  
\*Disney reports fantastic initial subscriber count for Disney+.  
\*Disney reports ESPN+ growing in-line with expectations.  


**Neutral Outlook Model:**  
\*Current revenue segments continue to grow at 18% Y.O.Y.  
\*Disney reports mediocre numbers for initial subscriber count to Disney+ (as they are expected and will be viewed as a neutral event).  


**Negative Outlook Model:**  
\*Market is affected by recession, Disney sensitivity to economic pressures.  
\*Growth slowing at media networks.  
\*Growth slowing at parks and resorts.  
\*Very low numbers for initial subscriber count to Disney+.",2019-11-01

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 4th, 2019.

# **It’s getting to be the best time of year for stocks, and the Dow could soon set a new high  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/the-dow-could-soon-join-other-benchmarks-at-a-record-as-strong-november-seasonality-kicks-in.html)**
*****
> As November unfolds, stocks should continue to make gains in one of the best months of the year for the market, and it’s very likely the Dow will soon join other indexes in setting new highs.
*****
> The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both traded in record territory in the past trading week, boosted by some better economic news, a better-than-expected earnings season, and hopes that trade talks will soon lead to a first-phase deal between the U.S. and China. On Friday, China said it reached a consensus with the U.S. in principle after a phone call among high-level negotiators.
*****
> Analysts say stocks could follow the seasonal trends higher, barring problems in trade talks. The market is starting the best three months of the year historically, and it has a few catalysts in the week ahead. There are a number of economic reports, the most important of which will be the ISM services PMI on Tuesday.
*****
> Third-quarter earnings season continues, with about 80 S&P 500 companies reporting, including media companies Disney and News Corp. and chipmaker Qualcomm.
*****
> # Top months ahead for stocks
> November is the third-best month for the S&P 500, which has been higher two-thirds of the time since World War II with an average 1.3% gain, according to CFRA. As good as November has been, December is even better, and as the No. 1 month, it is up 76% of the time with an average 1.6% gain. November, however, is the month that has seen the most new highs for the S&P, on a percentage basis, according to CFRA.
*****
> “Investors likely remain too skeptical on the impact of Brexit, the U.S.-China trade talks and the impeachment hearings. They’re too skeptical that the market can advance,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Many strategists say the efforts by Democrats to impeach Trump is not hurting stock prices currently but it could if there are any developments that would put his re-election in doubt.
*****
> “I think November and December are pretty much going to buck the emotional trend right now. The market is telling us it wants to go higher,” Stovall said.
*****
> Of the more than 350 S&P companies that have reported earnings, 76% beat earnings estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are down about 0.8% for the quarter, based on companies that have reported already and estimates.
*****
> “This will be the 31st consecutive quarter in which actuals exceed estimates, but as much as earnings are coming in better for the quarter, they’re going down in terms of Q4 and 2020. That’s not good,” said Stovall. But he said stocks could be lifted by the end of the trade war, the impact of lowered interest rates and a possible tax cut from the White House.
*****
> “I think because the market is doing so well, it might be telling us we’re underestimating forward growth. Prices lead fundamentals,” he said.
*****
> The S&P and Nasdaq soared into record territory Friday after the October jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls grew by 128,000, much greater than expected. The number was weaker due to the strike against General Motors but not as weak as feared.
*****
> The Fed also added to positive sentiment with a rate cut on Wednesday, but the central bank went out of its way to signal a pause in policy.
*****
> “The rally is definitely broadening out. The measured move is 3,200 on the S&P 500 by year-end. In the last two sessions, we retested and spent some time above the 3,025 area. Today’s move showed some needed power, after a jobs report that was Goldilocks: It had something for everyone, not too strong to have the Fed as a headwind but strong enough to keep recession fears away,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. “Today’s move lends some power to the bulls.”
*****
> Redler said Apple’s performance this week was a big boost to sentiment. It ended the week up 3.7%, at a new all-time high, after strong earnings. “Traders love when Apple leads the way,” he said.
*****
> The S&P 500 was higher for a fourth week in a row, its longest winning streak since March. The S&P ended the week at 3,066, up 1.5% for the week, while the Nasdaq closed at a record 8,386, up 1.7% for the week. The Dow gained 1.4% for the week, lifted by a 301-point bounce Friday. It finished the week at 27,347, 0.2% below its all-time high of 27,398.
*****
> Historically, industrials have had the best gains on average in November, going back to 1995. Industrial stocks have been up an average 2.9%, followed by materials, up 2.7%, consumer discretionary, up 2.6% and then technology, up 2.4%, according to CFRA data.
*****
> “The cliche thing is everyone is focused on the breakout. I think the key technical event that’s been developing for weeks, it’s really been this rotation toward cyclicals,” said Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat.
*****
> He said he expects the Dow to break to new highs soon. “We think the market is strong through year end and well into 2020. We continue to think the market cycle low developed in late 2018. This is the next leg up in the bull market,” he said.
*****
> # What are bonds saying?
> The bond market did not respond in the same way as stocks to the jobs number. Yields were slightly higher Friday but remained near or below the level they were at just prior to the Fed rate cut on Wednesday.
*****
> “We’re actually down on the week. That tells you what the bond market thinks about the economic landscape, particularly with the jobs report. I know there’s a lot of enthusiasm about it,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. “The bond market continues to send a very different message than the optimism in the equities market. The pace of job growth is still slowing, and this number is going to get revised multiple times. Everything is pointing to a slowdown in growth.”
*****
> The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.73% Friday afternoon, and it had been at 1.80% at the end of the prior week.
*****
> “I think it’s a bit of moderation from the sell-off we saw last week. The Fed was pretty much in line with what people were expecting,” said Ben Jeffery, a rate strategist at BMO. “I think probably stocks are viewing it as the Fed is comfortable leaving rates on hold, so many recessionary fears are a bit overblown. You could make the argument the bond market is less convinced about that.”
*****
> However, Stovall said it’s a positive for stocks when the yield on the 10-year is lower than the yield on the S&P 500, now about 2%.
*****
> “I would say another positive for stocks is historically when the dividend yield on the S&P 500 has exceeded the yield on the 10-year note. The average 12-month return for the S&P has exceeded 22%,” he said.

# Typical November Trading: First Month of “Best Months”

> November’s long-term track record has been stellar. It is the number one month of the year for S&P 500 since 1950 with an average gain of 1.6%, up 47 times in 69 years. DJIA’s record matches S&P 500, up 47 of 69 with an average gain of 1.6% although November is DJIA’s second best month. NASDAQ also averages a 1.6% gain in November (second best), up 33 times in 48 years (since 1971).

> Over the more recent 21-year period, 1998 to 2018, November’s average performance has remained solid. November has opened well with gains during the first four or five trading days depending on index. From there trading has become rather choppy with gains receding through mid-month before a low around the fourteenth trading day. At which point bullish holiday spirit has kicked in around Thanksgiving propelling all indexes to a strong rally to finish the month.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 11/1/19

> It was an extremely busy week for economic data with over 40 releases on the calendar. A vast majority came in either inline or worse relative to expectations or the previous period, while only 27% of releases came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading.

> The Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index was the first release of the week, turning back into negative territory in September. The Dallas Fed’s Manufacturing Activity index was also released on Monday and also missed estimates while shifting negative. The Conference Board’s reading on consumer confidence also softened unexpectedly as the spread between present conditions and expectations widened further. Housing data was somewhat mixed as prices slowed slightly, but pending home sales was much better than expected. Wednesday’s GDP release also came in stronger than expected with solid personal consumption. Core PCE and other inflation indicators like the Employment Cost Index were inline with expectations. Finally, Wednesday also saw the FOMC rate decision which resulted in rated cut another 25 bps, as expected. ADP’s stronger than expected employment data, preceded a solid NFP Report on Friday. Nonfarm Payrolls were expected to show 85K added jobs in the month of October which would have been a substantially weaker number than the 136K increase the prior month. Instead, actual results showed 128K added jobs, which was better than all but the highest of estimates (140K). Another focus on Friday was the Markit and ISM readings on manufacturing. Both were expected to improve from the prior month which they in fact did but by less than estimates were calling for. Markit's preliminary PMI was originally showing a stronger reading of 51.5. Instead, the final reading came in at 51.3 which was still the highest reading since April so the report wasn't entirely bad. Meanwhile, the ISM index ticked up off of last month's reading of 47.8, its lowest levels since June of 2009. This was in part thanks to the readings on new orders and employment improving. Aside from these improvements, ISM's indices—unlike Markit—are still showing contraction in the manufacturing space.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco-1.png))**

> The economic calendar slows down next week with around half as many releases as this week. Final durable and capital goods data and factory orders will take up the entirety of Monday’s reports. Durable goods orders are not expected to show any change from the preliminary readings, but factory orders are expected to show moderation in September. On Tuesday, we will get the services counterparts to today’s ISM and Markit manufacturing gauges. While both manufacturing readings missed, ISM’s Non-Manufacturing index is anticipated to rise to 53.5. Quarterly mortgage delinquencies and foreclose data will also be out on Tuesday. Wednesday will see more quarterly data with the Q3 preliminary releases of Nonfarm Productivity and Unit Labor costs. Following this week’s weaker Confidence report from the Conference Board, next Friday we will get further clarification on sentiment with the University of Michigan’s preliminary November data.

# Price-to-Earnings Around the Globe

> Every Wednesday, we release our Global Macro Dashboard, which tracks major data economic and market data points from 23 of the largest global economies. One stat we include is each country's P/E ratio for their respective equity markets. India continues to have the highest valuation with a P/E of 26.9. That compares to the US which is now valued at 20.1x earnings and the fifth-highest of the countries tracked. This is also higher than the average P/E for all of these countries which is 17.02. Other countries with notably high valuations include Norway, Germany, and Switzerland. Russia, on the other hand, has by far the lowest valuation of just 6.41, the only country with a P/E in the single digits.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE1.png))**

> Compared to where things stood six months and one year ago, valuations around the globe have collectively risen. The world average now stands at 17.0 versus 16.4 at the end of April and 15.1 last October. While the average multiple has increased, only 60% of the countries tracked have seen valuations increase over the last 6 months while 74% have risen over the past year. Germany's P/E has actually risen the most of these having jumped to the third-highest P/E of all countries (22.6). Six months and one year ago, Germany (EWG) actually had a below-average P/E. Multiple expansion can come in the form of higher prices and/or lower earnings, and in the case of Germany, the culprit has been weaker earnings.

> Even though it currently continues to hold the number one spot on the list, multiples in India (INDA) have actually fallen over the past six months from 30.4 down to the current level of 26.9. Given INDA has fallen over 2.5%, this lower valuation makes better sense than the jump in Germany. Similarly, in regards to the US, the ratio rising to over 20 from 19.28 comes is a result of the S&P 500's 3% gain as earnings have been pretty flat.

> Compared to one year ago, it is a similar story. As is the case now, Russia and Hong Kong have had the lowest valuations over the past six months and one year, although they have risen in that time. The valuation for most countries have risen over the past year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-6m.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-Y.png))**

> Summarizing in the table below, there is a bit of a mixed picture in regards to how P/E ratios have changed with performance over the past half-year and year. One would expect the ratio to increase as equities rise, but that has not necessarily been the universal case. For countries like Norway (ENOR) and Germany (EWG), valuations have risen the most in spite of equity markets that have experienced declines over the past six months (Norway's declines being the fourth-worst of the 23 countries) and only modest gains in the past year. On the other hand, Russia (RSX) has the lowest valuation of all countries despite having outperformed dramatically over the last six to twelve months. RSX has also not seen any major surge in valuation in that time as earnings have kept up with prices. Meanwhile, other countries like India (INDA), Switzerland (EWL), Taiwan (EWT) and the US (SPY) have seen this dynamic react more in line with what could be expected.

# Guidance Trends Lower

> Our good friend (and a former boss) Laszlo Birinyi used to hammer home that ""it's all about the guidance!"" when it comes to earnings reports for specific companies. That is indeed very true as investors discount stocks based on forward projections more than what they've done in the past. On the subject of guidance, this season we've been seeing a lot more companies lower guidance than raise guidance, which has resulted in a pretty big tick lower in our guidance spread reading on our Earnings Explorer page (available to Bespoke Institutional members).

> Our guidance spread reading shows the difference between the percentage of companies that have raised guidance and lowered guidance over the last three months on a rolling basis. A positive reading means more companies have raised guidance than lowered guidance over the last three months and vice versa for a negative reading. As you can see, the reading is currently at -6.48 percentage points, which is well below the historical average of -2.97. (It's notable that historically the average guidance spread has been negative, which tells us that in general companies like to under-promise and over-deliver.) The guidance spread completely tanked in the first quarter of 2019 before stabilizing and rallying back during the summer. While it hasn't been in positive territory all year, the spread did briefly get above its historical average during the Q2 reporting period in July.

> A negative guidance reading means companies are less optimistic about the future than they could be, but it's not necessarily a bearish sign for the stock market. If anything, it gives companies an easier chance at beating estimates going forward as long as the economy doesn't completely fall off a cliff. As you can see in the second chart below that extends our guidance spread reading all the way back to 2003, the current reading is hardly a negative outlier to be concerned about. The only time the spread really collapsed was in mid to late 2008 in the midst of the Financial Crisis. Want to see Bespoke's best analysis?

# The U.S. Economy Chugs Along

> Gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed for a third quarter, but the U.S. economy is still chugging along at an average pace.

> GDP grew 1.9% in the third quarter, its slowest pace of growth since the fourth quarter of 2018, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. Still, GDP increased 2% year over year last quarter, slightly below 2.1% year-over-year average growth since the cycle started in July 2009.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/solid-consumer-spending_1.png?ssl=1))**

> The composition of growth last quarter showed U.S. consumers pulled the economy along once again. Consumer spending contributed 1.9 percentage points to the GDP increase during the quarter, while government spending added 0.4 percentage points. Housing contributed 0.2 percentage points, a nice surprise after residential investment dragged on growth for six straight quarters.

> Business spending reduced overall GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points, its biggest drag on growth since the fourth quarter of 2015. Growth in capital expenditures (capex) has stalled as U.S. companies have shelved expansion plans amid a surge in global uncertainty.

> “The economy continues to muddle through at an average pace of growth,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While we’re not surprised to see another dull quarter for capex, we’d like to see business spending eventually pick up this late in the cycle. Higher business spending could provide a boost to productivity, and higher productivity could jumpstart GDP growth.”

> Unfortunately, we don’t expect to see a material increase in capex growth until the United States and China make more significant progress on the trade front. The U.S.-China limited trade deal could provide some lift as tensions thaw, but we think companies may need to see more evidence of a larger compromise before feeling confident enough to spend.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",2019-11-01
dqlan0,12,54,wallstreetbets,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 4th, 2019",0.94,1572735534.0,1572706734.0,"Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 4th, 2019.

# **It’s getting to be the best time of year for stocks, and the Dow could soon set a new high  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/the-dow-could-soon-join-other-benchmarks-at-a-record-as-strong-november-seasonality-kicks-in.html)**
*****
> As November unfolds, stocks should continue to make gains in one of the best months of the year for the market, and it’s very likely the Dow will soon join other indexes in setting new highs.
*****
> The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both traded in record territory in the past trading week, boosted by some better economic news, a better-than-expected earnings season, and hopes that trade talks will soon lead to a first-phase deal between the U.S. and China. On Friday, China said it reached a consensus with the U.S. in principle after a phone call among high-level negotiators.
*****
> Analysts say stocks could follow the seasonal trends higher, barring problems in trade talks. The market is starting the best three months of the year historically, and it has a few catalysts in the week ahead. There are a number of economic reports, the most important of which will be the ISM services PMI on Tuesday.
*****
> Third-quarter earnings season continues, with about 80 S&P 500 companies reporting, including media companies Disney and News Corp. and chipmaker Qualcomm.
*****
> # Top months ahead for stocks
> November is the third-best month for the S&P 500, which has been higher two-thirds of the time since World War II with an average 1.3% gain, according to CFRA. As good as November has been, December is even better, and as the No. 1 month, it is up 76% of the time with an average 1.6% gain. November, however, is the month that has seen the most new highs for the S&P, on a percentage basis, according to CFRA.
*****
> “Investors likely remain too skeptical on the impact of Brexit, the U.S.-China trade talks and the impeachment hearings. They’re too skeptical that the market can advance,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Many strategists say the efforts by Democrats to impeach Trump is not hurting stock prices currently but it could if there are any developments that would put his re-election in doubt.
*****
> “I think November and December are pretty much going to buck the emotional trend right now. The market is telling us it wants to go higher,” Stovall said.
*****
> Of the more than 350 S&P companies that have reported earnings, 76% beat earnings estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are down about 0.8% for the quarter, based on companies that have reported already and estimates.
*****
> “This will be the 31st consecutive quarter in which actuals exceed estimates, but as much as earnings are coming in better for the quarter, they’re going down in terms of Q4 and 2020. That’s not good,” said Stovall. But he said stocks could be lifted by the end of the trade war, the impact of lowered interest rates and a possible tax cut from the White House.
*****
> “I think because the market is doing so well, it might be telling us we’re underestimating forward growth. Prices lead fundamentals,” he said.
*****
> The S&P and Nasdaq soared into record territory Friday after the October jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls grew by 128,000, much greater than expected. The number was weaker due to the strike against General Motors but not as weak as feared.
*****
> The Fed also added to positive sentiment with a rate cut on Wednesday, but the central bank went out of its way to signal a pause in policy.

> “The rally is definitely broadening out. The measured move is 3,200 on the S&P 500 by year-end. In the last two sessions, we retested and spent some time above the 3,025 area. Today’s move showed some needed power, after a jobs report that was Goldilocks: It had something for everyone, not too strong to have the Fed as a headwind but strong enough to keep recession fears away,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. “Today’s move lends some power to the bulls.”
*****
> Redler said Apple’s performance this week was a big boost to sentiment. It ended the week up 3.7%, at a new all-time high, after strong earnings. “Traders love when Apple leads the way,” he said.
*****
> The S&P 500 was higher for a fourth week in a row, its longest winning streak since March. The S&P ended the week at 3,066, up 1.5% for the week, while the Nasdaq closed at a record 8,386, up 1.7% for the week. The Dow gained 1.4% for the week, lifted by a 301-point bounce Friday. It finished the week at 27,347, 0.2% below its all-time high of 27,398.
*****
> Historically, industrials have had the best gains on average in November, going back to 1995. Industrial stocks have been up an average 2.9%, followed by materials, up 2.7%, consumer discretionary, up 2.6% and then technology, up 2.4%, according to CFRA data.
*****
> “The cliche thing is everyone is focused on the breakout. I think the key technical event that’s been developing for weeks, it’s really been this rotation toward cyclicals,” said Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat.
*****
> He said he expects the Dow to break to new highs soon. “We think the market is strong through year end and well into 2020. We continue to think the market cycle low developed in late 2018. This is the next leg up in the bull market,” he said.
*****
> # What are bonds saying?
> The bond market did not respond in the same way as stocks to the jobs number. Yields were slightly higher Friday but remained near or below the level they were at just prior to the Fed rate cut on Wednesday.
*****
> “We’re actually down on the week. That tells you what the bond market thinks about the economic landscape, particularly with the jobs report. I know there’s a lot of enthusiasm about it,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. “The bond market continues to send a very different message than the optimism in the equities market. The pace of job growth is still slowing, and this number is going to get revised multiple times. Everything is pointing to a slowdown in growth.”
*****
> The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.73% Friday afternoon, and it had been at 1.80% at the end of the prior week.
*****
> “I think it’s a bit of moderation from the sell-off we saw last week. The Fed was pretty much in line with what people were expecting,” said Ben Jeffery, a rate strategist at BMO. “I think probably stocks are viewing it as the Fed is comfortable leaving rates on hold, so many recessionary fears are a bit overblown. You could make the argument the bond market is less convinced about that.”
*****
> However, Stovall said it’s a positive for stocks when the yield on the 10-year is lower than the yield on the S&P 500, now about 2%.
*****
> “I would say another positive for stocks is historically when the dividend yield on the S&P 500 has exceeded the yield on the 10-year note. The average 12-month return for the S&P has exceeded 22%,” he said.

# Typical November Trading: First Month of “Best Months”

> November’s long-term track record has been stellar. It is the number one month of the year for S&P 500 since 1950 with an average gain of 1.6%, up 47 times in 69 years. DJIA’s record matches S&P 500, up 47 of 69 with an average gain of 1.6% although November is DJIA’s second best month. NASDAQ also averages a 1.6% gain in November (second best), up 33 times in 48 years (since 1971).

> Over the more recent 21-year period, 1998 to 2018, November’s average performance has remained solid. November has opened well with gains during the first four or five trading days depending on index. From there trading has become rather choppy with gains receding through mid-month before a low around the fourteenth trading day. At which point bullish holiday spirit has kicked in around Thanksgiving propelling all indexes to a strong rally to finish the month.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 11/1/19

> It was an extremely busy week for economic data with over 40 releases on the calendar. A vast majority came in either inline or worse relative to expectations or the previous period, while only 27% of releases came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading.

> The Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index was the first release of the week, turning back into negative territory in September. The Dallas Fed’s Manufacturing Activity index was also released on Monday and also missed estimates while shifting negative. The Conference Board’s reading on consumer confidence also softened unexpectedly as the spread between present conditions and expectations widened further. Housing data was somewhat mixed as prices slowed slightly, but pending home sales was much better than expected. Wednesday’s GDP release also came in stronger than expected with solid personal consumption. Core PCE and other inflation indicators like the Employment Cost Index were inline with expectations. Finally, Wednesday also saw the FOMC rate decision which resulted in rated cut another 25 bps, as expected. ADP’s stronger than expected employment data, preceded a solid NFP Report on Friday. Nonfarm Payrolls were expected to show 85K added jobs in the month of October which would have been a substantially weaker number than the 136K increase the prior month. Instead, actual results showed 128K added jobs, which was better than all but the highest of estimates (140K). Another focus on Friday was the Markit and ISM readings on manufacturing. Both were expected to improve from the prior month which they in fact did but by less than estimates were calling for. Markit's preliminary PMI was originally showing a stronger reading of 51.5. Instead, the final reading came in at 51.3 which was still the highest reading since April so the report wasn't entirely bad. Meanwhile, the ISM index ticked up off of last month's reading of 47.8, its lowest levels since June of 2009. This was in part thanks to the readings on new orders and employment improving. Aside from these improvements, ISM's indices—unlike Markit—are still showing contraction in the manufacturing space.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco-1.png))**

> The economic calendar slows down next week with around half as many releases as this week. Final durable and capital goods data and factory orders will take up the entirety of Monday’s reports. Durable goods orders are not expected to show any change from the preliminary readings, but factory orders are expected to show moderation in September. On Tuesday, we will get the services counterparts to today’s ISM and Markit manufacturing gauges. While both manufacturing readings missed, ISM’s Non-Manufacturing index is anticipated to rise to 53.5. Quarterly mortgage delinquencies and foreclose data will also be out on Tuesday. Wednesday will see more quarterly data with the Q3 preliminary releases of Nonfarm Productivity and Unit Labor costs. Following this week’s weaker Confidence report from the Conference Board, next Friday we will get further clarification on sentiment with the University of Michigan’s preliminary November data.

# Price-to-Earnings Around the Globe

> Every Wednesday, we release our Global Macro Dashboard, which tracks major data economic and market data points from 23 of the largest global economies. One stat we include is each country's P/E ratio for their respective equity markets. India continues to have the highest valuation with a P/E of 26.9. That compares to the US which is now valued at 20.1x earnings and the fifth-highest of the countries tracked. This is also higher than the average P/E for all of these countries which is 17.02. Other countries with notably high valuations include Norway, Germany, and Switzerland. Russia, on the other hand, has by far the lowest valuation of just 6.41, the only country with a P/E in the single digits.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE1.png))**

> Compared to where things stood six months and one year ago, valuations around the globe have collectively risen. The world average now stands at 17.0 versus 16.4 at the end of April and 15.1 last October. While the average multiple has increased, only 60% of the countries tracked have seen valuations increase over the last 6 months while 74% have risen over the past year. Germany's P/E has actually risen the most of these having jumped to the third-highest P/E of all countries (22.6). Six months and one year ago, Germany (EWG) actually had a below-average P/E. Multiple expansion can come in the form of higher prices and/or lower earnings, and in the case of Germany, the culprit has been weaker earnings.

> Even though it currently continues to hold the number one spot on the list, multiples in India (INDA) have actually fallen over the past six months from 30.4 down to the current level of 26.9. Given INDA has fallen over 2.5%, this lower valuation makes better sense than the jump in Germany. Similarly, in regards to the US, the ratio rising to over 20 from 19.28 comes is a result of the S&P 500's 3% gain as earnings have been pretty flat.

> Compared to one year ago, it is a similar story. As is the case now, Russia and Hong Kong have had the lowest valuations over the past six months and one year, although they have risen in that time. The valuation for most countries have risen over the past year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-6m.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-Y.png))**

> Summarizing in the table below, there is a bit of a mixed picture in regards to how P/E ratios have changed with performance over the past half-year and year. One would expect the ratio to increase as equities rise, but that has not necessarily been the universal case. For countries like Norway (ENOR) and Germany (EWG), valuations have risen the most in spite of equity markets that have experienced declines over the past six months (Norway's declines being the fourth-worst of the 23 countries) and only modest gains in the past year. On the other hand, Russia (RSX) has the lowest valuation of all countries despite having outperformed dramatically over the last six to twelve months. RSX has also not seen any major surge in valuation in that time as earnings have kept up with prices. Meanwhile, other countries like India (INDA), Switzerland (EWL), Taiwan (EWT) and the US (SPY) have seen this dynamic react more in line with what could be expected.

# Guidance Trends Lower

> Our good friend (and a former boss) Laszlo Birinyi used to hammer home that ""it's all about the guidance!"" when it comes to earnings reports for specific companies. That is indeed very true as investors discount stocks based on forward projections more than what they've done in the past. On the subject of guidance, this season we've been seeing a lot more companies lower guidance than raise guidance, which has resulted in a pretty big tick lower in our guidance spread reading on our Earnings Explorer page (available to Bespoke Institutional members).

> Our guidance spread reading shows the difference between the percentage of companies that have raised guidance and lowered guidance over the last three months on a rolling basis. A positive reading means more companies have raised guidance than lowered guidance over the last three months and vice versa for a negative reading. As you can see, the reading is currently at -6.48 percentage points, which is well below the historical average of -2.97. (It's notable that historically the average guidance spread has been negative, which tells us that in general companies like to under-promise and over-deliver.) The guidance spread completely tanked in the first quarter of 2019 before stabilizing and rallying back during the summer. While it hasn't been in positive territory all year, the spread did briefly get above its historical average during the Q2 reporting period in July.

> A negative guidance reading means companies are less optimistic about the future than they could be, but it's not necessarily a bearish sign for the stock market. If anything, it gives companies an easier chance at beating estimates going forward as long as the economy doesn't completely fall off a cliff. As you can see in the second chart below that extends our guidance spread reading all the way back to 2003, the current reading is hardly a negative outlier to be concerned about. The only time the spread really collapsed was in mid to late 2008 in the midst of the Financial Crisis. Want to see Bespoke's best analysis?

# The U.S. Economy Chugs Along

> Gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed for a third quarter, but the U.S. economy is still chugging along at an average pace.

> GDP grew 1.9% in the third quarter, its slowest pace of growth since the fourth quarter of 2018, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. Still, GDP increased 2% year over year last quarter, slightly below 2.1% year-over-year average growth since the cycle started in July 2009.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/solid-consumer-spending_1.png?ssl=1))**

> The composition of growth last quarter showed U.S. consumers pulled the economy along once again. Consumer spending contributed 1.9 percentage points to the GDP increase during the quarter, while government spending added 0.4 percentage points. Housing contributed 0.2 percentage points, a nice surprise after residential investment dragged on growth for six straight quarters.

> Business spending reduced overall GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points, its biggest drag on growth since the fourth quarter of 2015. Growth in capital expenditures (capex) has stalled as U.S. companies have shelved expansion plans amid a surge in global uncertainty.

> “The economy continues to muddle through at an average pace of growth,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While we’re not surprised to see another dull quarter for capex, we’d like to see business spending eventually pick up this late in the cycle. Higher business spending could provide a boost to productivity, and higher productivity could jumpstart GDP growth.”

> Unfortunately, we don’t expect to see a material increase in capex growth until the United States and China make more significant progress on the trade front. The U.S.-China limited trade deal could provide some lift as tensions thaw, but we think companies may need to see more evidence of a larger compromise before feeling confident enough to spend.

# **It’s getting to be the best time of year for stocks, and the Dow could soon set a new high  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/the-dow-could-soon-join-other-benchmarks-at-a-record-as-strong-november-seasonality-kicks-in.html)**
*****
> As November unfolds, stocks should continue to make gains in one of the best months of the year for the market, and it’s very likely the Dow will soon join other indexes in setting new highs.
*****
> The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both traded in record territory in the past trading week, boosted by some better economic news, a better-than-expected earnings season, and hopes that trade talks will soon lead to a first-phase deal between the U.S. and China. On Friday, China said it reached a consensus with the U.S. in principle after a phone call among high-level negotiators.
*****
> Analysts say stocks could follow the seasonal trends higher, barring problems in trade talks. The market is starting the best three months of the year historically, and it has a few catalysts in the week ahead. There are a number of economic reports, the most important of which will be the ISM services PMI on Tuesday.
*****
> Third-quarter earnings season continues, with about 80 S&P 500 companies reporting, including media companies Disney and News Corp. and chipmaker Qualcomm.
*****
> # Top months ahead for stocks
> November is the third-best month for the S&P 500, which has been higher two-thirds of the time since World War II with an average 1.3% gain, according to CFRA. As good as November has been, December is even better, and as the No. 1 month, it is up 76% of the time with an average 1.6% gain. November, however, is the month that has seen the most new highs for the S&P, on a percentage basis, according to CFRA.
*****
> “Investors likely remain too skeptical on the impact of Brexit, the U.S.-China trade talks and the impeachment hearings. They’re too skeptical that the market can advance,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Many strategists say the efforts by Democrats to impeach Trump is not hurting stock prices currently but it could if there are any developments that would put his re-election in doubt.
*****
> “I think November and December are pretty much going to buck the emotional trend right now. The market is telling us it wants to go higher,” Stovall said.
*****
> Of the more than 350 S&P companies that have reported earnings, 76% beat earnings estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are down about 0.8% for the quarter, based on companies that have reported already and estimates.
*****
> “This will be the 31st consecutive quarter in which actuals exceed estimates, but as much as earnings are coming in better for the quarter, they’re going down in terms of Q4 and 2020. That’s not good,” said Stovall. But he said stocks could be lifted by the end of the trade war, the impact of lowered interest rates and a possible tax cut from the White House.
*****
> “I think because the market is doing so well, it might be telling us we’re underestimating forward growth. Prices lead fundamentals,” he said.
*****
> The S&P and Nasdaq soared into record territory Friday after the October jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls grew by 128,000, much greater than expected. The number was weaker due to the strike against General Motors but not as weak as feared.
*****
> The Fed also added to positive sentiment with a rate cut on Wednesday, but the central bank went out of its way to signal a pause in policy.
*****
> “The rally is definitely broadening out. The measured move is 3,200 on the S&P 500 by year-end. In the last two sessions, we retested and spent some time above the 3,025 area. Today’s move showed some needed power, after a jobs report that was Goldilocks: It had something for everyone, not too strong to have the Fed as a headwind but strong enough to keep recession fears away,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. “Today’s move lends some power to the bulls.”
*****
> Redler said Apple’s performance this week was a big boost to sentiment. It ended the week up 3.7%, at a new all-time high, after strong earnings. “Traders love when Apple leads the way,” he said.
*****
> The S&P 500 was higher for a fourth week in a row, its longest winning streak since March. The S&P ended the week at 3,066, up 1.5% for the week, while the Nasdaq closed at a record 8,386, up 1.7% for the week. The Dow gained 1.4% for the week, lifted by a 301-point bounce Friday. It finished the week at 27,347, 0.2% below its all-time high of 27,398.
*****
> Historically, industrials have had the best gains on average in November, going back to 1995. Industrial stocks have been up an average 2.9%, followed by materials, up 2.7%, consumer discretionary, up 2.6% and then technology, up 2.4%, according to CFRA data.
*****
> “The cliche thing is everyone is focused on the breakout. I think the key technical event that’s been developing for weeks, it’s really been this rotation toward cyclicals,” said Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat.
*****
> He said he expects the Dow to break to new highs soon. “We think the market is strong through year end and well into 2020. We continue to think the market cycle low developed in late 2018. This is the next leg up in the bull market,” he said.
*****
> # What are bonds saying?
> The bond market did not respond in the same way as stocks to the jobs number. Yields were slightly higher Friday but remained near or below the level they were at just prior to the Fed rate cut on Wednesday.
*****
> “We’re actually down on the week. That tells you what the bond market thinks about the economic landscape, particularly with the jobs report. I know there’s a lot of enthusiasm about it,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. “The bond market continues to send a very different message than the optimism in the equities market. The pace of job growth is still slowing, and this number is going to get revised multiple times. Everything is pointing to a slowdown in growth.”
*****
> The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.73% Friday afternoon, and it had been at 1.80% at the end of the prior week.
*****
> “I think it’s a bit of moderation from the sell-off we saw last week. The Fed was pretty much in line with what people were expecting,” said Ben Jeffery, a rate strategist at BMO. “I think probably stocks are viewing it as the Fed is comfortable leaving rates on hold, so many recessionary fears are a bit overblown. You could make the argument the bond market is less convinced about that.”
*****
> However, Stovall said it’s a positive for stocks when the yield on the 10-year is lower than the yield on the S&P 500, now about 2%.
*****
> “I would say another positive for stocks is historically when the dividend yield on the S&P 500 has exceeded the yield on the 10-year note. The average 12-month return for the S&P has exceeded 22%,” he said.

# Typical November Trading: First Month of “Best Months”

> November’s long-term track record has been stellar. It is the number one month of the year for S&P 500 since 1950 with an average gain of 1.6%, up 47 times in 69 years. DJIA’s record matches S&P 500, up 47 of 69 with an average gain of 1.6% although November is DJIA’s second best month. NASDAQ also averages a 1.6% gain in November (second best), up 33 times in 48 years (since 1971).

> Over the more recent 21-year period, 1998 to 2018, November’s average performance has remained solid. November has opened well with gains during the first four or five trading days depending on index. From there trading has become rather choppy with gains receding through mid-month before a low around the fourteenth trading day. At which point bullish holiday spirit has kicked in around Thanksgiving propelling all indexes to a strong rally to finish the month.

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 11/1/19

> It was an extremely busy week for economic data with over 40 releases on the calendar. A vast majority came in either inline or worse relative to expectations or the previous period, while only 27% of releases came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading.

> The Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index was the first release of the week, turning back into negative territory in September. The Dallas Fed’s Manufacturing Activity index was also released on Monday and also missed estimates while shifting negative. The Conference Board’s reading on consumer confidence also softened unexpectedly as the spread between present conditions and expectations widened further. Housing data was somewhat mixed as prices slowed slightly, but pending home sales was much better than expected. Wednesday’s GDP release also came in stronger than expected with solid personal consumption. Core PCE and other inflation indicators like the Employment Cost Index were inline with expectations. Finally, Wednesday also saw the FOMC rate decision which resulted in rated cut another 25 bps, as expected. ADP’s stronger than expected employment data, preceded a solid NFP Report on Friday. Nonfarm Payrolls were expected to show 85K added jobs in the month of October which would have been a substantially weaker number than the 136K increase the prior month. Instead, actual results showed 128K added jobs, which was better than all but the highest of estimates (140K). Another focus on Friday was the Markit and ISM readings on manufacturing. Both were expected to improve from the prior month which they in fact did but by less than estimates were calling for. Markit's preliminary PMI was originally showing a stronger reading of 51.5. Instead, the final reading came in at 51.3 which was still the highest reading since April so the report wasn't entirely bad. Meanwhile, the ISM index ticked up off of last month's reading of 47.8, its lowest levels since June of 2009. This was in part thanks to the readings on new orders and employment improving. Aside from these improvements, ISM's indices—unlike Markit—are still showing contraction in the manufacturing space.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco-1.png))**

> The economic calendar slows down next week with around half as many releases as this week. Final durable and capital goods data and factory orders will take up the entirety of Monday’s reports. Durable goods orders are not expected to show any change from the preliminary readings, but factory orders are expected to show moderation in September. On Tuesday, we will get the services counterparts to today’s ISM and Markit manufacturing gauges. While both manufacturing readings missed, ISM’s Non-Manufacturing index is anticipated to rise to 53.5. Quarterly mortgage delinquencies and foreclose data will also be out on Tuesday. Wednesday will see more quarterly data with the Q3 preliminary releases of Nonfarm Productivity and Unit Labor costs. Following this week’s weaker Confidence report from the Conference Board, next Friday we will get further clarification on sentiment with the University of Michigan’s preliminary November data.

# Price-to-Earnings Around the Globe

> Every Wednesday, we release our Global Macro Dashboard, which tracks major data economic and market data points from 23 of the largest global economies. One stat we include is each country's P/E ratio for their respective equity markets. India continues to have the highest valuation with a P/E of 26.9. That compares to the US which is now valued at 20.1x earnings and the fifth-highest of the countries tracked. This is also higher than the average P/E for all of these countries which is 17.02. Other countries with notably high valuations include Norway, Germany, and Switzerland. Russia, on the other hand, has by far the lowest valuation of just 6.41, the only country with a P/E in the single digits.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE1.png))**

> Compared to where things stood six months and one year ago, valuations around the globe have collectively risen. The world average now stands at 17.0 versus 16.4 at the end of April and 15.1 last October. While the average multiple has increased, only 60% of the countries tracked have seen valuations increase over the last 6 months while 74% have risen over the past year. Germany's P/E has actually risen the most of these having jumped to the third-highest P/E of all countries (22.6). Six months and one year ago, Germany (EWG) actually had a below-average P/E. Multiple expansion can come in the form of higher prices and/or lower earnings, and in the case of Germany, the culprit has been weaker earnings.

> Even though it currently continues to hold the number one spot on the list, multiples in India (INDA) have actually fallen over the past six months from 30.4 down to the current level of 26.9. Given INDA has fallen over 2.5%, this lower valuation makes better sense than the jump in Germany. Similarly, in regards to the US, the ratio rising to over 20 from 19.28 comes is a result of the S&P 500's 3% gain as earnings have been pretty flat.

> Compared to one year ago, it is a similar story. As is the case now, Russia and Hong Kong have had the lowest valuations over the past six months and one year, although they have risen in that time. The valuation for most countries have risen over the past year.

> Summarizing in the table below, there is a bit of a mixed picture in regards to how P/E ratios have changed with performance over the past half-year and year. One would expect the ratio to increase as equities rise, but that has not necessarily been the universal case. For countries like Norway (ENOR) and Germany (EWG), valuations have risen the most in spite of equity markets that have experienced declines over the past six months (Norway's declines being the fourth-worst of the 23 countries) and only modest gains in the past year. On the other hand, Russia (RSX) has the lowest valuation of all countries despite having outperformed dramatically over the last six to twelve months. RSX has also not seen any major surge in valuation in that time as earnings have kept up with prices. Meanwhile, other countries like India (INDA), Switzerland (EWL), Taiwan (EWT) and the US (SPY) have seen this dynamic react more in line with what could be expected.

# Guidance Trends Lower

> Our good friend (and a former boss) Laszlo Birinyi used to hammer home that ""it's all about the guidance!"" when it comes to earnings reports for specific companies. That is indeed very true as investors discount stocks based on forward projections more than what they've done in the past. On the subject of guidance, this season we've been seeing a lot more companies lower guidance than raise guidance, which has resulted in a pretty big tick lower in our guidance spread reading on our Earnings Explorer page (available to Bespoke Institutional members).

> Our guidance spread reading shows the difference between the percentage of companies that have raised guidance and lowered guidance over the last three months on a rolling basis. A positive reading means more companies have raised guidance than lowered guidance over the last three months and vice versa for a negative reading. As you can see, the reading is currently at -6.48 percentage points, which is well below the historical average of -2.97. (It's notable that historically the average guidance spread has been negative, which tells us that in general companies like to under-promise and over-deliver.) The guidance spread completely tanked in the first quarter of 2019 before stabilizing and rallying back during the summer. While it hasn't been in positive territory all year, the spread did briefly get above its historical average during the Q2 reporting period in July.

> A negative guidance reading means companies are less optimistic about the future than they could be, but it's not necessarily a bearish sign for the stock market. If anything, it gives companies an easier chance at beating estimates going forward as long as the economy doesn't completely fall off a cliff. As you can see in the second chart below that extends our guidance spread reading all the way back to 2003, the current reading is hardly a negative outlier to be concerned about. The only time the spread really collapsed was in mid to late 2008 in the midst of the Financial Crisis. Want to see Bespoke's best analysis?

# The U.S. Economy Chugs Along

> Gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed for a third quarter, but the U.S. economy is still chugging along at an average pace.

> GDP grew 1.9% in the third quarter, its slowest pace of growth since the fourth quarter of 2018, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. Still, GDP increased 2% year over year last quarter, slightly below 2.1% year-over-year average growth since the cycle started in July 2009.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/solid-consumer-spending_1.png?ssl=1))**

> The composition of growth last quarter showed U.S. consumers pulled the economy along once again. Consumer spending contributed 1.9 percentage points to the GDP increase during the quarter, while government spending added 0.4 percentage points. Housing contributed 0.2 percentage points, a nice surprise after residential investment dragged on growth for six straight quarters.

> Business spending reduced overall GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points, its biggest drag on growth since the fourth quarter of 2015. Growth in capital expenditures (capex) has stalled as U.S. companies have shelved expansion plans amid a surge in global uncertainty.

> “The economy continues to muddle through at an average pace of growth,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While we’re not surprised to see another dull quarter for capex, we’d like to see business spending eventually pick up this late in the cycle. Higher business spending could provide a boost to productivity, and higher productivity could jumpstart GDP growth.”

> Unfortunately, we don’t expect to see a material increase in capex growth until the United States and China make more significant progress on the trade front. The U.S.-China limited trade deal could provide some lift as tensions thaw, but we think companies may need to see more evidence of a larger compromise before feeling confident enough to spend.

Revenue Estimate: $250m-$255mConsensus Thoughts: This is a dogshit upgraded TiVo that no one wants and many are foisted upon with the purchase of a new TV.

**Roku, Inc**. ROKU is set to report third-quarter 2019 results on Nov 6.

For  the quarter, the company expects revenues between $250 million and $255  million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged  at $258.1 million, which indicates growth of 48.8% from the figure  reported in the year-ago quarter.

Further, the consensus mark for third-quarter loss has been steady at 28 cents over the past 30 days.

The  company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing  four quarters, delivering average positive surprise of 76.7%.

Investors  would watch for active accounts growth, which is an important metric  for Roku. In the last reported quarter, active accounts surged 39% year  over year to 30.5 million. Streaming hours jumped 72% year over year to  9.4 billion. Moreover, Average Revenue per User (ARPU) increased 27% to  $21.06 (on a trailing 12-month basis).",2019-11-05

I think this is a game-changing acquisition.....algos went whack, under appreciated as of today....that will change quickly. 

Amazon and Trade Desk should be worried about them acquiring DataXu. Jeff Bezos definitely does not like shaking hands on an agreement with a partner that eventually agrees to be bought out by his rival.

And now Roku owns them.....

Oh and also last week Roku added support for an Apple TV app. 

It’s unlikely knowing Apple‘s track record that it will enable a Apple TV app on their streaming competitors platform (Amazon Fire)

I now or soonish is a great time to get in, but do your homework and challenge me. Maybe I’m missing something 

They have the largest market share already.

Now what do you think will happen to apples market share now that Roku has Apple TV support? Exactly. 

The Roku app are built into 33% most smart TVs and that doesn’t seem to be slowing.

I was having a real shitty month (and year) until this week.  Thank you Roku.  I bought calls post earnings because the drop didn't seem right.  I sold some calls expiring 11/15 earlier this week even though I thought it was still going up.  I took the proceeds from those to buy 11/22 calls.  Sold some today to just take profit and planning to keep that money out for the time being as I still have open positions of about $25K.  Hopefully it doesn't take a dump on me.

dxbqrt,60,39,wallstreetbets,The Complete Streaming Wars Synopsis.,0.78,1573962952.0,1573934152.0,"Welcome autists, gather round as I tell the tale of the most misunderstood conflict in modern media.

While Disney+ has been creating a lot of noise and sparking momentum for Disney stock, the streaming wars as it stands now, is being misunderstood by the vast majority of you. This post is in an effort to save you from losing money in the streaming services industry, so that you may lose it more autistically in Semiconductors and microchips.  Before we get into it, lets take a look at who the players are in the space. As a forward, I do not have positions in any companies mentioned as this is not my area of expertise. You may be asking, why are you posing if you don't know the streaming services space? Well, because its WSBs, and apparently none of you understand it either cause I haven't seen any real DD on it. I have posted current company cash balances for each one mentioned as this is an incredibly cash intensive business (excluding Roku perhaps)

&#x200B;

**NFLX**

Net Cash *Deficit*: - 8 Billion

Netflix is a giant in the streaming industry, but trades at an extremely high multiple of \~93x P/E currently. Its biggest strengths are its experience in streaming services, it’s already developed customer base, it’s investments and developments into streaming specific infrastructure and most importantly, it’s development of home-grown content in foreign countries. Netflix and other streaming services are competing for very different customer bases outside of the US, in that it is one of the only streaming services that develops content for its local user base whether that be US based, In India, or somewhere in the EU. As emerging markets continue to grow Netflix is best poised to produce original content that is geographically/culturally specific and relevant. 

&#x200B;

**AAPL**

Net Cash Balance: 98 Billion

Apple is a relatively new contender in the streaming space. Its biggest strength is its overwhelmingly healthy balance sheet, and its devoted user base of apple services and products. Apple will be best suited to pay practically any price it chooses to develop content or acquire it from third parties. Apple products and services are also widespread in many parts of eastern Asia and are gaining traction throughout other markets. Much remains “Up in the air” so to speak as far as what will be Apples final product in the streaming space. While most of the companies current value comes from Iphone sales at about 42%, future forecasts show that services including streaming is a must to maintain Apples growth.

&#x200B;

**AMZN**

Net cash balance: 18 Billion

Amazon has continually struggled to develop their streaming services and as such has begun to shift it’s attention into many other parts of its core business. Amazons web services is by far the most critical part of its business followed secondly by its consumer discretionary / retail space. Amazon is not well positioned to continue the dragging battle that is the streaming wars as it simply doesn’t represent any significant revenue income. Although this may sound similar to Apple, at least Apple plans on developing their streaming services to reach a large portion of their revenue as Iphone sales continue to contract, where as amazon has a lack luster plan to develop its current streaming platforms. Simply put, Amazons could flat out stop streaming services entirely and the company  (and consumers IMO) wouldn't even notice.

&#x200B;

**DIS**

Net Cash *Deficit*: 44 Billion

Disney has been a streaming service in a sense for a long time, so it is somewhat puzzling to me that they haven’t developed a direct to consumer streaming platform already. Overall Cable and its place in the world is quickly fading, even in developing and emerging markets as is generally far more cost efficient to stream rather than cable for consumers. It is for this reason that Disney is forced to cannibalize its own revenues in from cable rights in order to offer streaming now. Overtime, this means a much lesser improvement to balance sheet performance as their new Disney+ streaming service is essentially their replacement / solution to the upcoming losses from the disappearance of cable.

&#x200B;

**ROKU**

Net cash Balance: 388 Million

Roku is an add supported business and the ultimate winner in the streaming space. As more and more streaming platforms and content offerings become available, Rokus value becomes more and more apparent to consumers. Rokus biggest hurdles are its current unprofitability, and its lacking cash balance, which it needs to continue development.

&#x200B;

Summary (All highly opinionated of course):

Disney+ may be the stellar service that investors believe it is, but its success is needed, not optional, thus making Disney far less appetizing. Additionally, its user base will be almost exclusively US based which is by far the most crowded streaming space. Most of the growth in streaming services across the board comes from emerging markets and foreign market penetration. Disney opening its own streaming platform is a must to maintain the company’s relevance. Additionally, Netflix, although incredibly overvalued will ultimately be the only company to continually develop user growth in emerging markets apart from locally grown services, the only exception to this may be Apple. Apple may be able to develop outside of US markets in areas where they have high user counts, unfortunately, these markets are also being subject to quite a bit of economic uncertainty and external forces. Finally, Roku is the only clear cut and dry winner in this space. Roku is pioneering the field it’s currently in. Roku is much like the shovel salesman at the entrance to the gold mine, the only difference is, each time the gold mine entrance moves farther west Roku has already paved the road to beat the miners to it.  
 

In any case, the overvaluation of Disney will be corrected and Roku will continue to grow its path to profitability as more and more streaming services are offered. Disney plus, Apple TV and many others are not a “Netflix” killer given the different consumer bases and objectives of the companies and Amazon will most likely begin to quietly back out of the streaming space over the years, not grow their stake in it.

dybx9p,46,47,options,Options Trading - 4 Month Review,0.9,1574149990.0,1574121190.0,"I've been meaning to do this for a while. When I was starting out trading, I really wanted to know what the world would look like a year into it. Now that I've been trading actively for about 5 months I think I'm qualified to give some perspective.

Starting Portfolio Size : \~$90000

Asset Class : U.S Equites

I know I know I'm a beginner, what am I doing trading a $90000 portfolio blah blah. Everyone told me to start small. I didn't listen. I do believe the  no.1 reason most businesses fail is due to lack of capital. Having more capital allows me to make safer trades (more on this later)

I primarily trade the infamous ""wheel"" strategy, taught to my by u/ScottishTrader. I started out buying options for directional moves but soon realized making directional trades on the buy side is EXTREMELY hard, so decided to be a writer instead. Options writting + large capital are a good combo.

My first month was August, 1 week after making my first couple trades, which were selling cash covered puts on $ANET. Trump-china-trade-war happened. The market made some vicious moves on the down side and I was down \~$4000 within a week. I really felt like shit. I was tempted to close out my trade and book my losses but I decided to roll over the contract instead for the next month ( thank you reddit ! ). Over all I ended the month down $200. I wrote more about this  on my [blog](https://theuppersection.com/my-first-big-day-trading-loss/).

The next three months, Sept, October, November have been much better. I'm netting \~2500$ a month which meets my inital goal of  2-3% a month. A strategy that I've found useful is running the wheel on high IV stocks like ROKU/OKTA/TWLO and make directional bets with value stocks that are easier to predict. I look to buy a growth stock when its relativey 'cheap' and then sell covered calls against it. This has been pretty profitable. Weather it continues to be this way in the later stage of the credit cycle we will see.

Since start, I have beaten SPY by 6%. My aim is to maintain this level of growth for the next quarter.

I follow some basic rules that I've learnt  from some bad trades.

\- No single trade can use more than 10-13%  for the capital

\- Long/Short portfolio hedging with inverse assets/instruments

\- NEVER hold through earnings.

Along with this I also have a very extensive journal where I detail all my trades/profit/capital commitment etc

Coming back to the elephant in the room - Starting out Trading with a lot of capital. So I wouldn't recommend this to anyone else, however I do feel trading with a large portolio has helped me progress a lot faster than I would have if I was  trading with say 10-20k. For one I've been able to experiment with different assets at the same time and seen how they react for the same variables. Second, and what i think of as an 'emotional edge' - which is basically that I'm comfortable being down a couple thousand and not getting emotional about it. Getting comfortable in uncomfortable situations has been my hardest lesson and I don't think it would have been the same thing trading 10-20k.

Finishing up, I wanna thank this community. Ya'll have helped soo much. I know I have  a long way to go, but its been a beautiful journey being able to make money in the markets from scratch.

A year following a year dedicated to R&D where the company expected little revenue with money being out back into the products development, in a market that is fairly new and booming with new services which many people have a variety of. And they are a backbone that hosts them all with no real competition because the services aren't even in the same market as their primary revenue source... Which is devices (for now). Ok Boomers.

Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:1 with the March 2020 30.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 510).

Also gapping up this morning is Audentes Therapeutics Inc. (BOLD + $30.19 to $58.80) following news that Astellas Pharma Inc. (ALPMY $17.08) has entered into a definitive agreement to buy the gene therapy developer for roughly $3B or $60.00/share in cash. BOLD puts are outnumbering calls better than 5:1 which is primarily being driven by activity on the February 2020 40.00 put (volume is 1,549). Other gene therapy names moving higher in sympathy with Audentes include: Uniqure NV (QURE + $9.22 to $64.00), Regenxbio Inc. (RGNX + $2.62 to $43.30), Ultragenyx Pharma Inc. (RARE + $1.24 to $40.38), Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT + $2.17 to $110.96).  

Lastly, shares of Roku Inc. (ROKU + $6.20 to $142.28) are recovering from yesterday’s ~15% drop (on a Morgan Stanley downgrade) this morning after Needham raised their price target to a “Street-high” price target of $200.00 (from $150.00) and maintained their “Buy” rating. Needham analyst Laura Martin said that she believes ROKU is a “key beneficiary” of the shift towards streaming video and should be valued as an internet aggregator, similar to YouTube in the video space. Calls are outpacing puts roughly 5:2 with the December 6th 145.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 5,429).

 

New 52-week highs (26 new highs today): Constellation Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CNST + $0.61 to $45.46), Galapagos NV (GLPG + $5.01 to $200.40), Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. (LW + $0.61 to $84.64), PTC Therapeutics Inc. (PTCT + $0.85 to $48.46), Sony Corp. (SNE + $0.93 to $64.21)

Notable Call Activity
Some unusual call activity (~14:1 over puts) is being seen in Comcast Corp. (CMCSA + $0.02 to $43.66) as option traders primarily target the December 20th 44.00 call. Volume on this contract is 23,879 versus open interest of 3,971, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The bulk of the activity on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought for between $0.48-0.51 each, including a 7,100 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.49, which suggests bullish intent.  

Chewy Inc. (CHWY + $0.40 to $24.23): Calls are outpacing puts better than 5:1 which is mostly being driven by activity on the December 20th 24.00 call. Volume on this contract is 6,329 (vs. open interest of 3,568) which mostly consisted of a 2,500 block that was bought at the ask price of $1.50 and (a little later) a 2,500 block that was bought at the ask price of $1.60 (both suggesting bullish intent). The positioning comes ahead of the company’s Q3 earnings report which is scheduled to be released next Monday (December 9th) after the market close.

Today’s Bearish Activity 
Leading the percentage decliners list this morning is Cara Therapeutics Inc. (CARA - $7.31 to $18.57) after the drug developer reported mixed results from a mid-stage study of its treatment for pruritus (itchy skin in kidney disease patients). The treatment reduced itching along a scale known as WI-NRS by 4.4 points (vs. 3.3 in the placebo group), meeting the main goal of the study, but the difference in the proportion of patients who had a greater than 3 point reduction in itching scores was not statistically significant. Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 2:1 with the December 20th 17.50 put topping the most actives list (volume is 2,121).

Also trading to the downside is Coupa Software Inc. (COUP - $9.77 to $139.17) even though the cloud-based business spend management platform beat quarterly earnings estimates and provided better-than-expected guidance last night after the market close. For the third quarter the company reported earnings of $0.20 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.14 beat and above prior guidance of $0.05-0.08) on revenue that increased 50.9% year-over-year to $101.78M and guided Q4 EPS to a range of $0.03-0.06 on revenue of $101.5-102.5M (vs. the respective ($0.02) and $99.50M consensus estimates). Puts are outpacing calls nearly 2:1 with the December 20th 20.00 put topping the most actives list (volume is 7,111). 

 

New 52-week lows (75 new lows today): Alarm.com Inc. (ALRM - $0.08 to $41.89), Apache Corp. (APA - $1.09 to $18.45), Corecivic Inc. (CXW + $0.11 to $15.03), Netgear Inc. (NTGR - $0.15 to $24.29), Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP - $0.16 to $50.51)

Notable Put Activity
Some unusual put activity (nearly 30:1 over calls) is being seen in Phillips 66 Inc. (PSX - $1.37 to $112.96) which is primarily being driven by activity on the January 10th 2020 121.00 put. Volume on this contract is 11,202 (vs. open interest of 0) which nearly entirely consisted of an 11.2K block that was bought at the ask price of $8.60. We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bearish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.

SPDR Select Sector Materials ETF (XLB - $0.53 to $58.91): Puts are outpacing calls better than 6:1 which is primarily being driven by a 5K block that was sold on the January 2020 57.00 put for $0.83 when the bid/ask spread was $0.82 x $0.87 (open interest is 3,570). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume that the block trader believes that XLB will remain at or above the $57.00 price level or is comfortable taking a long 500K share position in this ETF at an effective purchase price of $56.17 in the even that it closes below $57.00 at expiration.

iShares IBOXX High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG - $0.22 to $86.32): Puts are outpacing calls roughly 50:1 with the December 27th 85.50 put topping the most actives list. Volume is 10,000 (vs. open interest of 203) which entirely consisted of a 10K block that was bought at the ask price of $0.38 (suggesting bearish intent).

Volume Signals     
BP PLC (BP - $0.40 to $36.91): A couple of large blocks were seen simultaneously trading out on the April 2020 expiration earlier this morning:

39.00 call (open interest is 3,507): a 6,500 block was bought for $0.77 when the bid/ask spread was $0.63 x $0.78
43.00 call (open interest is 2,075): a 6,500 block was sold at the bid price of $0.13
We know these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figures and it appears that a $4.00-wide bull call spread was established for a net debit of $0.64 (x 6,500 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which suggests that the block trader sees BP closing above the break-even price of $39.64 at expiration.

Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB - $0.58 to $35.28): A couple of large blocks were seen simultaneously trading out on the February 2020 expiration earlier this morning:

37.50 call (open interest is 4,764): a 7,260 block was bought at the ask price of $1.27
42.50 call (open interest is 2,585): a 7,260 block was sold for $0.31
We know these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figures and it appears that a $5.00-wide bull call spread was established for a net debit of $0.96 (x 7,260 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which suggests that the block trader believes SLB will close above the break-even price of $38.46 at expiration.

Gauging Volatility
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX + 1.41 to 16.33) is trading higher for the third day in a row and at a two-month high (intraday range is 14.61-17.98) as equity markets are firmly lower across the board around the mid-day mark today (DJI - 385, SPX - 31, COMPX - 107). VIX option volume has been average today at 299,922 contracts (#5 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been slightly put-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 1.08). The most actively traded contract is the December 18th 13.00 put as volume is 45,410 versus open interest of 268,357.",2019-12-03

Roku has been getting fucked or doing the fucking. I think if it gets hit again tomorrow I’ll snag some calls (weeklies of course) and be done with it. Maybe a debit spread for 145/150. I think at 140 it looks juicy as fuck. 

Costco: I don’t know why but I think this looks good. If it’s red tomorrow might pick up a debit spread for 300/305. 

Microsoft: the first company I’m bearish on this week. I love Microsoft but I think it’s due for a pullback soon. One thing to say is that it’s been pumped hard to get price up there. If it’s green tomorrow I’m going to enter a put debit spread for 150/145. One thing to mention is that Microsoft is a fucking wild hog and can destroy you if you’re not good with sizing. I’m looking to get contracts for cheap with a lot of potential profit. If I can’t get them cheap I don’t really want to allocate my money into them. 

Amazon: I thought the bounce Friday would be bigger. It wasn’t. But it was necessary after the past few days of red. I think this could tank for a few days though again. Low 1700’s and I’ll get some mid 1700 debit spreads. Either for this week or next. One thing I noticed is that spreads for next month don’t have a lot of room for profit. Option writers could be pricing in a big move upwards which is why the contracts have that premium, or they’re just expensive as fuck even for spreads. 

Beyond meat: I hit this bitch 2 days in a row and got away with it. Honestly left a lot on the table Friday with my 76/78 call spreads but I got a gain and was more concerned about how I could lose money with amazon. Which I did. Anyways. I think beyond could run a bit more. If it gets closer to 80 I’d consider doing a put debit spread but I’d be careful. I think it’s got some gas in the tank and monkey behind the wheel. 

I hope y’all liked this shit. And I hope it’s actually decent advice. If it’s not, I hope it fucks your account harder than Alex Adams fucks his stepsister. After all, this is THE WSB.",2019-12-06

Today, trading down 22% at $16.02 as of this posting.  I'm personally in 3000 shares at 15.72 on the crazy dip.  I have firepower capital to purchase another 5000 shares on dips.

Lets face it, road construction isn't going under anytime soon.  As the economy develops, so will infrastructure.  $ROAD is pretty much a monopoly in the states it operates it.  It has significant deferred revenue (since government contracts take a shit long time to pay out) which means future capital will come in fast and huge.  It sits on a potential goldmine of landmark revenue due to continued investments into the domestic economy by Trump.  It has nearly 0 debt, cash on hand, and actually turns a profit.  It is quickly expanding in the USA with recent acquisitions of 
asphault firms further cementing (that's a PUN) its foothold into the road construction monopoly in the states.

Today's trading range was from 15.53 to 18.74 which is a HUGE range.  I got in on the lower end of the range (and it still looks to be on the lower end of the range).  I see this trading back to around its upper range 18.74 in 1-2 weeks easily.  It's currently trading hugely down today due to overreaction (and profit taking) from its missed earnings (which wasn't as bad as it looks if you read into the financials).

If you followed my previous DD suggestion on $SCVL, you'd have made over 10% and banked huge gains on that (I'm still holding that FYI).  So listen to me again you autists, stop playing with turd shit like $PTON, $ROKU, $TSLA.

***UPDATE 1 (12/10):*** The bounce from its lows of 15.53 to its current price of 16.43 (as of this update) is a testament.  BELIEVE.

***UPDATE 2 (12/10):*** Caught another dip of 1000 shares at 16.38 just now.  New average is 4000 shares @ 15.88.

***UPDATE 3 (12/10):*** Another dip buy here of 1000 shares at 16.25.  New average is 5000 shares @ 15.97.

***UPDATE 4 (12/10):*** Looks like some noobs are buying at the ask which is driving it up a bit here.  I expect a pullback because of these noobs buying at the ask.  A close above 17 would be mighty bullish for tomorrow.


***UPDATE 5 (12/11):*** Price target raised to 18.50 by Imperial Capital.  Possible gap up.

***UPDATE 6 (12/11):*** It gapped up here.  I personally would not re-enter here as I'm expecting a pullback to high 16's.  If it doesn't pullback, don't FOMO, there's always other tickers.

***UPDATE 7 (12/12):*** That pullback to high 16's happened.  Yep.  Hope you autists listened to me.  Or are you still losing money on crap like $CRWD, $PTON, $ROKU, $BYND?

***UPDATE 8 (12/16):*** The pullback to high 16's on (12/12) was the entry to get in.  Now it's breakaway to 18's but will consolidate (range bound) this week a bit.

***UPDATE 9 (12/17):*** Nice little bump today.  Though still in consolidation phase so will be range bound from low 17's to high 17's for a few days until breakaway to 18.50ish.

***UPDATE 10 (12/18):*** Still rangebound, tiny bump up today.

The markets have never seen a influx of new traders like this. they are buying and losing constantly they are doing plays they do not understand at all.

""You’re on the Fractional Shares wait-list with 465187 other people."" this is what i saw on Robinhood today when I thought to myself how many people are signing up to get partial shares.

""when your taxi driver is giving you stock advice the market has gotten too big, the fall is immanent""  Im not here to give bear gang a rallying cry quite the opposite.

I am stating that with these new users and the fact that alot of sales are switching to majority of sales being online now we will continue to see two things. First, Shockingly high sales,  I am talking way more than market makers expected so that prices jump but then melt back down.

(My conspiracy side says this is intended so that a few of the new commoners are ""lucky winners"" lottery style and as they go screaming in the town square of the hard work they did to earn their tendies they now have ten more commoners running to the markets to get their winnings too but the reason is beside the point)

Second, The other thing is due to internet hype and word of mouth travelling so fast now certain stocks will become overvalued then dive down as they melt up over months. Roku being a prime example of that.

The market no longer knows what it is doing and if you see something that is obvious to go in but should be priced in inverse your self because these morons running the show havent been pricing shit in for months.

Also, if you see something everyone is talking about and it is obvious it is going up these morons who dont know how to trade are going to increase the stock price above were it actually comes in and even on good knews the stock will shit. so lesson is inverse everyone, inverse the hype, inverse yourself on thinking someone knows what they are doing. make your tendies. cant go tits up.

ec3adt,27,19,wallstreetbets,I think ROKU is gonna start to hit new monthly highs,0.76,1576651088.0,1576622288.0,"Roku is a momo darling, and also extremely volatile.  Ive been trading it for a while now, and recently got the hang of making a decent amount of money in it.  I posted a while back about going from 1500 or so to 12.5k and reinvested 2500 to go at it again.  I put all 2500 into some calls for early janaury and assuming this thing bounces off the current floor, ima let it ride and then buy some 160s for mid January.  If my plan takes hold, easy gains.  

Why do I think it will do this?  

1.  Its a momo darling.  Enough shorted to get some filthy short covering runs, but tons of people pumping this so it tends to have crazy runs, especially after big pullbacks.  

2.  It just had a big pullback from their CFO leaving, which, was mostly priced in from him selling all of his shares about a month ago.  No news yet on why he left, but I assume its just a normal poaching.  He left on good terms it seems seeing it was a several month long process and no backlash or outspoken anything happend.  

3.  They are in a great place to hire a solid CFO and get a run from this.  ROKUs financiald have been doing extremely well.  Relatively low debt, insane growth, and the stock price reflects this.  Im sure they have more than enough money to hire an amazing CFO that is looking to capitalize on their amazing run and further it.  

4.  It just bounced off a strong floor and ran up several % only to get hit with the dumb money sell off once the cfo news announced, but it held strong.  In other words, held strong through the bad news, could easily rip once new cfo plans are announced, probably will happen soon.  

5.  Everyones been bragging about their holiday sales the whole time.  They have been selling insane amounts, but the CFO news took the hit.  Usually once it bounces of floors like this, a wave of upgrades will come in.  My guess is sometime soon a wave of upgrades is gonna come in, itll rally, theyll release good news about holiday sales, and kill it on the ER and itll rally to new monthly highs, and close to ATH then find a new floor.  As is the trend.  

Godspeed fellow autists.  I see this rallying tommorrow after holding strong today.  I think it will open in the green, and do a nice run up, and upgrades will fuel the further run.

So in that spirit, I wanted to open up a discussion about emerging markets and the companies that enable them in hopes that our collective insight will point us towards profitable investments that we can all benefit from. 

Below is a list of the emerging markets that come to my mind. This certainly isn't exhaustive, so input of additional upcoming markets is appreciated. Just to reiterate, the goal isn't to speculate which companies will be the leaders in these areas (ex. NFLX for Streaming Services), but rather identify the companies who are best positioned to enable these industries as a whole (ex. ROKU for Streaming Services):

* Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
* 5G Wireless Networks
* SmartHome Devices & IoT
* Meat Substitutes / Lab-grown meat products
* Satellite Internet
* Virtual Reality
* Cloud Infrastructure and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
* Drone Technology
* Streaming Services
* Electric Vehicles (EVs)

My uncle gave me a little bit of info on stocks, ETFs index funds and mutual funds. Fast forward to today, after having done lots of research on my own, I have $6,750.65 total in my portfolio, and I plan on adding $100 a month to the FXAIX index fund.

The majority of my money is in the FXAIX index fund, with $5,014.11. I also have 2 Roku shares that I bought early this year for around $102, and 2 Alibaba shares for $157. I also invested in the FCOM, FTEC, and FREL ETFs, with FCOM and FTEC going up 10.57% and 18,45% since I bought them. I also have 3 Disney shares that I bought earlier this year for $137.65. My only loser so far is CGC, which has dropped 54% since I bought them (6 shares). I am not too worried though because I believe in 5, 10 or even 20 years from now that the value will be a lot higher because marijuana is becoming more generally accepted in the world. 

I want to know what you all think of my portfolio from what I described. Am I on pace for a good sum of money if I were to sell it all in 40 years? Did I choose the right index funds and stocks?

On November 12, this was at $19. Now after a 10% jump yesterday it’s at $35. Luckin is a coffee company created to compete with Starbucks (and eventually blow it out of the water). It specializes in deliveries as you can’t actually enter a cafe other than to make an order. The reason this is so popular in China is because of coffee culture at work ; coworkers like to order together as a group as a form of bonding . China would also never let a foreign company become a leader in something ((especially as stagnant as Starbucks)). Let’s see what their counter is to KFC and MCD .. that’s the real challenge for them . Everyone please post your Luckin stories so we can get a proper circle jerk going!",2019-12-24

I thought ""Hey, spy calls have been free money and the new years is off strong, I will buy some spy calls because its not going down anytime soon""

so, I put some money in some spy calls literally expiring tomorrow, they were up nearly 100% from that end of day rally.  All it had to do was open slightly green and I was raking in tendies...

BUT THE FIRST DAY I TRY TO DO SOMETHING WE GO TO FUCKING WAR!?!?!  

Of course, I saw the AH rally and futures looking strong, I thought for sure I was gonna kill it tomorrow, but instead, I'm literally gonna lose every penny more than likely...  

This absolutely floors me though... I didn't touch SPY this entire bull market, not once.  I literally played roku mostly, and some other random stocks, but the first day I buy SPY calls, FD's at that, futures plummet because Orange man decided he wanted to provoke a war overnight instead of just letting me make some money... What a bunch of absolute garbage...

Please kill me.

Edit:  Like the Autist I am, I doubled down on SPY calls this morning and its recovering!!  Wish me luck lol

Edit2:  Im gay... And single handedly ended the Bull market...  Im sorry.  Im very sorry guys.

Edit3: On the bright side, Cramer said its a bad time to buy so inverse Cramer and I might get lucky lol.  But really.  Cramer, the ultimate hype man extraordinaire turns bearish the day I buy Calls.  Literally insane I actually single handedly ended the bull market and started a war.  

Went from up 25% two days ago to down 60% today. Im optimistic. Afterall, money is just paper anyway.  

 Final Edit 4: ok.  So.  Rode some dailies all the way up till just now.  Ended up selling on this spike down because I made like 20-30% and it dropped so I decided to take profits instead of holding while this dumpster fire unfolds.  Currently sitting at about down 40% overall, compared to my 2 days ago up 25-30% so not great, but better than my -60% earlier today.  Not gonna lie.  Its been a wild ride, prolly gonna do it again next week, I havent learned shit.  Im either going broke or gonna be rich.  Prolly broke.  But hey, its just paper anyway.  To the idiot that said ""this is on you for buying at ATH"" Its been at ATH for like 10 years bud.  

Final edit #2:  its my post, I can make as many edits as I want.  Fuck you.   Im dumbfounded I missed that massive drop right there.  Somehow sold my dailies for a gain and bought puts after to spiked down then back up, I bought puts at that top there.  So gonna ride these puts over the weekend as this dumpster fire political environment unfolds.  I assume theres just gonna be a massive cuckfest about to unfold over the weekend thatll give this atleast 1 more red day.  Who knows.

2019 was very good to me. I was up approximately 55% in my trading account. Biggest winning tickers included AMZN TSLA AAPL DIS. Biggest losers BA ROKU. Boeing on the way down, Roku on a sharp rebound rally.  


I mostly sell premium, often starting with way out of the money strangles. Time varies, but one month out is most common.  Delta is often 10 or less. Yes, the proverbial pennies in front of the steam roller. In 2019, it added up to a lot of pennies for a 55% gain.   


When the underlying moves, I sell more layers of options to keep the overall delta near the same. In 2019, I mostly leaned bullish. A couple of changes that I made this year was focusing on net delta, ignoring the number of winning and losing trades. On gap moves, I might buy at the money options, as a straight line approach to get to the desired delta. So part of the position becomes a ratio spread, long the atm option, short multiples of the otm options.  


I see myself as a relatively cautious trader, despite selling naked strangles on big dollar underlyings such as AMZN TSLA BA. After I got up about 30% for the year, I became more cautious. Overall, I am amazed at the 55% gain for year, considering how big a chicken I can be.  


Footnote: yes, I know, its really going to be the Year of the Rat coming up, but humor me. The college football championship game is this Monday. The Clemson Tigers are playing the LSU Tigers, so Tigers will win the championship.

--Jowemaha

Human beings usually overlook the simple in favor of the complicated. The most obvious and most directly causal impact on the price of a good is supply and demand. (Secondarily you have ""sentiment"" which tends to follow price. Thirdly you have growth. Fourthly you have earnings. Fifthly, almost entirely irrelevant, you have ""intelligent fundamental perspective."")

The company is selling 1 million shares on the open market ""from time to time"". In addition, after the massive run up, employees with stock options are taking money off the table. This company pays out a shit ton in stock based compensation, and has for years. So there is a lot of float ready to profit take as engineers get shook. In addition, with the price declining this profit taking has only accelerated. 

So far we have covered ""supply and demand"", and sentiment, and we are at growth. The growth is good but not exceeding expectations wildly anymore. So don't expect this to protect us from the much stronger factors 1&2. Earnings are nonexistent.

The fundamental perspective is debatable. I'm very very bullish but who knows. Remember I said ""intelligent fundamental perspective."" The reason this factor is so weak is that it is essentially nonexistent.

Conclusion: be like a thrifty motherfucker at Chipotle and wait for more dip. Stare down the minimum wage worker until she adds more sour cream. Play this stock short. Stock analysis is easy. Easier than selling rocks. Just remember your five stock factors and the order. Let's get this money baby. No excuse for failin'.",2020-01-10

They're cancelling flights to HK anyway through Monday but my flight is still on. The friend I'm staying with told me to come anyway because I always complain about how crowded HK is with people and all the sights and good restaurants are deserted rn so getting around is easy, I think she is right. Worth the risk. Eating all the Michelin starred dim sum with no wait is worth risking coronavirus.

HK time is 14 hours ahead of CST, so 10:30pm to 7:30am trading hours local time, that sucks. I'll sleep through ROKU earnings (it is a steal at under $120 imho, buy that shit up).

Will update if Hong Kong gets included in the flight ban and I get stuck and get infected and die.

edit. American just told me that when flights to Hong Kong resume Tuesday, they'll make a day-to-day decision on whether future flights will be cancelled. So there's still a shot they won't let me go and give me a refund. We'll see.

* U.S. stock futures were pointing to a higher open, but not close to erasing a significant portion of Friday’s coronavirus-driven sell-off. The Dow had its worst day since August on Friday. The S&P 500 since October. Both were pushed into negative territory for January. The Dow is now at its lowest since Dec. 18, with the S&P 500 finishing at its lowest since Dec. 30. The Nasdaq, however, did manage to finish January with a 2% gain. (CNBC)
* Chinese markets plunged on their return from the extended Lunar New Year holiday, and maintained steep declines by the close. The Shanghai composite fell 7.72% while the Shenzhen component dropped 8.45%. The moves in Chinese stocks were playing catch up as the coronavirus outbreak continues to widen. (CNBC)
* On today’s U.S. economic calendar, both the ISM manufacturing Index and December construction spending are released at 10 a.m. ET. Food distributor Sysco (SYY) is one of the few companies set to release quarterly earnings this morning, while Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) grabs the spotlight in today’s after-the-bell reports. The pace of earnings reports picks up substantially over the next few days, with 86 S&P 500 companies scheduled to issue numbers. (CNBC)
* Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg all have a good chance to leave today’s first-in-the-nation Iowa presidential caucuses with the most delegates.

Thousands of medical workers in Hong Kong went on strike, in hopes of convincing the city’s government to a complete shutdown of its borders with the mainland. (CNBC)
* Bernard Ebbers, a former telecom executive convicted in one of the largest corporate accounting scandals in U.S. history, died yesterday, just over a month after his early release from prison. The Canadian-born Ebbers was convicted in New York in 2005 on securities fraud and other charges and received a 25-year sentence. (AP)
* WeWork reportedly intends to name Sandeep Mathrani, a veteran in the real estate industry, as its new CEO. Mathrani was previously CEO at Brookfield Properties’ retail group, and is on the executive board and board of trustees for the International Council of Shopping Centers and the board of directors of Host Hotels & Resorts. (CNBC)

The Chiefs, which last appeared in a Super Bowl in 1970, won their second Vince Lombardi Trophy in three Super Bowl appearances. (CNBC)

With headcount growth expected to be greater in 2020, this further clouds operating income projections. 

However, the biggest bright spot from the quarter was the new disclosures, which now allow investors to track performance by major business line. Specifically, YouTube now has $3B run-rate subscription revenue with 20m subscribers and 2B MAU. Analysts estimate YouTube would be worth $200B standalone, which is about 1/5 of GOOGL's EV. YouTube would be a strong alternative to $NFLX, $ROKU, and $TTD, which are all trading at much higher multiples. A spinoff would also help make Google smaller since big is bad in DC.",2020-02-04

# **Markets could see a turbulent week as investors watch coronavirus, economy and Fed testimony  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/markets-could-see-a-turbulent-week-as-investors-watch-coronavirus-economy-and-election.html)**
*****
> The uncertainty around the coronavirus could continue to carry more weight in markets than corporate earnings or the consumer inflation and spending data expected in the week ahead.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday in his bi-annual appearance before Congress, and investors are watching to see if Powell looks ready to move away from the Fed’s neutral stand on interest rates.
*****
> Trading was volatile in the past week, with stocks sharply higher four of the five days as investors viewed the virus’ progress to be less rapid than feared. But by Friday, the death of the doctor who discovered the illness and the addition of restrictions in Shenzen, a key manufacturing hub, were among the headlines that renewed investor fears. By Friday, 31,000 people were reported to be infected, mostly in China, but the amount of new cases slowed for a second day, according to the World Health Organization.
*****
> Stocks were lower Friday even after a much stronger-than-expected January employment report showed 225,000 jobs were created — 65,000 more than expected. Treasury yields, higher much of the week, edged lower Friday, and the 10-year yield dipped below 1.60% once more.
*****
> “The data has been very positive, but it’s looking in the rear view mirror. It doesn’t take into account any concerns about the coronavirus yet,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
> Analysts have said volatility will now be a common theme in the stock market, regardless of which way it trades. That may have been apparent in the story of one stock in the past week — Tesla.
*****
> The electric car maker’s stock shot up in parabolic fashion to a high of $968.99 on Tuesday, and was trading more than $200 below that on Friday.
*****
> “I do believe what happened in Tesla just does show some of the euphoria that got into the marketplace,” said Matt Maley, Miller Tabak chief market strategist. Maley said some investors were comparing the surge higher to 1999, when the tech bubble was building. “I really laugh when people justify the rally by saying, it’s not as crazy as it was in 1999.”
*****
> Maley said now that the stock has “washed out” on the upside, there’s likely more downside ahead.
*****
> “Some of these comments in the last couple of days ... talking about how the retail investors piled into the stock. Of course, that’s usually a sign of a top as well,” he said.
*****
> # Brakes on growth
> UBS Global Wealth Management’s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele said next week could provide an important look at how the virus is impacting China’s economy.
*****
> “Next week, Chinese factories are set to reopen after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, and important indicators to note will be to what extent the virus spreads as people resume travel back to work, and how long it takes for production to return to full capacity,” he wrote, adding he still likes emerging markets despite the potential hit on their economies.
*****
> Economists expect the impact on the U.S. economy to be minimal, and say it should bounce back quickly.
*****
> Thursday’s consumer price index and Friday’s retail sales, industrial production and consumer sentiment will be watched closely by economists. ISM manufacturing data was stronger than expected in the past week, ending a period of contraction that started during the trade war.
*****
> The first quarter data has been providing a mixed picture of the economy, ahead of any impacts of the virus. Economists had been expecting manufacturing to get a boost after the trade deal, but Boeing’s production shut down and now the virus could muddy that picture.
*****
> “I think there’s been a little bit of chicken little about the economy for awhile. It ebbs and flows,” said Arone, noting the Fed is the backstop if growth is choked. “Most of the indicators indicate the economy is going to chug along.”
*****
> Powell testifies for two days before House and Senate committees on the state of the economy. Markets will be watching his comments closely to see what he has to say on the potential impact of the coronavirus. The markets have begun to price in more than one rate cut for this year, even though the Fed is not forecasting any.
*****
> “With the strong jobs, I think it’s going to be more of the same. They raised the bar pretty high for them to signal any policy changes,” said John Roberts, U.S. rate strategist at NatWest Markets. “They mentioned the coronavirus already. We could get more insight into what they’re thinking about that. That’s the main thing we’re looking for.”
*****
> China’s central bank has been adding stimulus, and that was seen as a booster for global stock markets in the past week.
*****
> Capital Economics on Friday said it expects the coronavirus to cost the world economy $280 billion in the first quarter.
*****
> “If we’re right, then this will mean that global GDP will not grow in [quarter over quarter] terms for the first time since 2009,” the economists wrote in a note. “We assume the virus will be contained soon, and that lost output is made up in subsequent quarters, so that world GDP reaches the level it would have done had there been no outbreak by the middle of 2021.”
*****
> # Earnings Bonanza
> Better-than-expected earnings have helped stoke the market’s recent gains. There are dozens of earnings expected in the week ahead, including CVS Health Wednesday and Pepsi, Nvidia and Kraft Heinz Thursday.
*****
> So far, more than 70% of companies are beating forecasts and profits are growing by 2.3%, when including both companies that have reported and those expected to report, according to Refinitiv. At the start of the earnings reporting period, earnings growth was expected to decline.
*****
> Analysts will also look to companies to continue disclosing how the virus is impacting their operations. VF Corp, for instance, said 60% of its stores in China are now closed, and those that remain open have serous declines.
*****
> # Playing Politics
> Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sent a shudder through markets when he began to rise in the polls ahead of Iowa’s caucuses. But the chaos in declaring a winner in Iowa this past week, leaves the Democratic field wide open. So New Hampshire’s primary Tuesday will also be important.
*****
> The left-leaning Sanders is viewed as negative for the stock market, but his main rivals, Joseph Biden and now Pete Buttigieg, who seems to have led in Iowa, are both moderates. Sanders leads in the New Hampshire polls and is expected to win his neighboring state.
*****
> “I think it’s going to continue to matter for quite some time, until we get clarity at least on who the Democratic candidate is going to be,” said Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO. ”[Buttigieg] would be much more business friendly than some of the other candidates. Does that make him more or less electable? If he’s more that could be a market negative development.”
*****
> The S&P 500 has gained 55% since Donald Trump became president, and analysts say he is viewed by investors as having the best policies for the stock market. Some Democrats, particularly Sanders, would raise taxes sharply.

# Week Before Presidents’ Day Bullish since 1990

> Page 100 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 points out Presidents’ Day as the poorest performing holiday of the eight holidays that are tracked. Unlike the others, the trading day before and the trading day after this three-day holiday weekend are both down on average over the past 40 years. However, the full week before the long holiday weekend has a bullish record. Since 1990 DJIA and S&P 500 have advanced 20 times with average weekly gains of 0.66% and 0.48% respectively. NASDAQ has one additional weekly decline while Russell 2000 has been the strongest, up 23 times with an average gain of 0.79%.

# Strong Jobs Report to Begin 2020

> U.S. hiring came in stronger than expected in January, rebounding from a disappointing December print.

> Nonfarm payrolls rose by 225,000 in January, far surpassing Bloomberg’s consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released today by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This number may help alleviate some investor unease over December’s somewhat weak reading. We argued at the time that December’s reading likely was due in large part to calendar effects and the volatility of month-to-month changes. We prefer to base our views of the labor market’s vitality on the larger trend, which, has been undeniably strong, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.

> Some investors have questioned how long hiring can remain elevated before we experience a worker shortage or a sharp rise in wages. The answer, according to this report, is not yet.

> In addition to the strong hiring numbers, workers also have enjoyed healthy wage gains. January saw average hourly earnings rise 3.1% year over year, a slight pickup from December, while average hours worked remained unchanged. “Today’s wage number exceeds inflation, meaning workers are growing their purchasing power in real terms and should be able to continue increasing their consumption of goods and services,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “But the number is also lower than the 4% threshold that has historically signaled an overheating job market and potential for subsequent economic and market volatility. This is a very encouraging report.”

> The one slight blip in today’s release showed the unemployment rate inching 0.1% higher to 3.6%. This was mainly due to changes to the size of the labor force, which affected revisions. Still, given the extremely low unemployment level, the volatility of month-to-month numbers, and the overwhelmingly positive tone of the other data points released today, we feel confident about the prospects for the U.S. consumer to continue powering this economic expansion through 2020 and beyond.

# New Highs Tilt Scales to Bulls

> China is cutting tariffs; the impeachment process has come to an end and the market is at new all-time highs. The coronavirus is still a concern, but apparently not as much as it was less than one week ago. Progress has been made. Official emergency declarations have mobilized a stronger response. China has quickly built additional hospitals and work is underway on a treatment. Gilead (GILD) appears to be the first to offer a potential cure although its drug remdesivir has not been approved to cure any disease yet. These recent developments along with solid earnings, have been the fuel to reverse the market’s late January retreat in just a few trading sessions this month.

> In the above charts, the market’s strength since October can be seen along with second half of January weakness. DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ have remained comfortably above their respective 200-day moving averages since October. In January only DJIA actually (and briefly) closed below its even higher 50-day moving average. The market’s rebound surge in February has also reversed negative readings from Stochastic, relative strength and MACD indicators.

> Momentum clearly favors the bulls and January’s negative finish remains unconfirmed as of today. As long as economic data and corporate earnings remain positive then the market is likely to continue the trend that has been in place since last October, higher. There are likely to be some dips along the way with the next possible soft patch arriving when earnings season nears its end later this month and/or in the first half of March.

# Typical February Trading: Tepid Month with Solid Mid-Month Rally

> February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&P 500 has averaged a measly 0.1%. Over the last 21-year period S&P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of 0.4% in February. February’s first trading day has historically been good, like today, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been rather lacking.

# Does A Lower January Have Bears Smiling?

> Stocks got off to a nice start in 2020, until the late January selloff due to the coronavirus outbreak fears. In the end, the S&P 500 Index fell only 0.2% for the month, but it did mark the end to a 4-month win streak. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2020?

> There’s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, “As goes January, so goes the year.” This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?

> As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.2% on average over the final 11 months and were higher less than 60% of the time.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/so-goes-january-so-goes-the-year.png?ssl=1))**

> Another way to look at this data shows the average full year return based on if stocks are higher in January or not. As you can clearly see, stocks have tended to have trouble gaining any traction over the rest of the year after a January loss, while a green January has been quite strong.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-january-barometer.png?ssl=1)**

> It isn’t all bad news though. Remember the S&P 500 was down only 0.2% in January, so one could argue that it was really flat. “Yes, a lower January is a potential worry for the bulls,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But it is worth noting the previous 5 times (and 7 of 8) when stocks were lower in January, those final 11 months rallied. So this might not be the clear cut bearish signal so many think it is.”

# January Trifecta Spoiled by Coronavirus

> The market decline on the last day of January spoiled what would have been the fourth consecutive January Trifecta. S&P 500 finished January down 0.2% and thus the January Barometer was negative.

> Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.7% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .743 batting average.

> This year’s combination of a positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days with a full-month January loss has only occurred eleven times (including this year) since 1950. In the previous ten occurrences S&P 500 was down six times in February with an average loss of 1.5%. However, over the remaining 11 months of the year, S&P 500 advanced 80% of the time with an average gain of 7.4%. Full-year performance was positive 70% of the time, but with an average gain of 2.9%.

I tried to buy some 10 4/17 150 Cs this morning and I missed the spike so I ended up going with the ole 4/17 160 Cs. I'm up $900 on them this morning, thoughts on earnings play? I'm thinking to hold until Thursday to play the run-up and sell before close.

Anyone else playing ROKU? Thoughts on selling around $135? Does anyone have any insider info? I feel like they must have had great holiday sales - I have 2 ROKU TVs in my NYC apartment and I just left my brothers and he has 5 around his house.

Edit: Up $1400 now.

Edit: Sold for $2100 profit (45%ish) Will be rebuying the same options if the price drops below $130.",2020-02-10

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, February 10th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/10/futures-steady-trump-new-budget-and-coronavirus-deaths-exceed-sars.html)

* With coronavirus concerns still very much in the mix, U.S. stock futures point to more losses for Wall Street following a Friday sell-off. The major averages all had their best weekly gains in months despite that Friday drop, but the trend is clearly negative as we head into the new week. The Nasdaq’s weekly gain last week was its largest since November 2018, even after a 0.5% fall on Friday. Tech has been February’s strongest sector so far, and the Consumer Staples sector finished last week at a record high. (CNBC)
* The Trump administration will release its fiscal 2021 budget today, which will show the economy growing at an average rate of 3% for the next 15 years. It’s also proposing to continue tax cuts for individuals through 2035 at a cost of $1.4 trillion, a figure that serves as a rough placeholder for President Donald Trump’s promised “Tax Cuts 2.0.” (CNBC)
* Treasury yields move higher ahead of Trump’s 2021 budget (CNBC)
* No economic releases are on today’s calendar. Two Fed officials have public speaking engagements today, with Fed Governor Michelle Bowman making a morning appearance in Florida and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker speaking this afternoon in Delaware. (CNBC)
* Allergan (AGN), Edgewell Personal Care (EPC), and Restaurant Brands International (QSR) are among the companies set to release quarterly earnings this morning. Callaway Golf (ELY) and XPO Logistics (XPO) issue numbers after the closing bell.
* Tesla (TSLA) shares were up 9% in the premarket this morning after a tumultuous week, which saw the stock move more than $100 per share in either direction in three of five sessions. Tesla posted 10 consecutive weekly gains and have risen 127% over that span. (CNBC)
* China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed 3,062 new coronavirus cases and 97 additional deaths, mostly in Hubei province. The government said a total of 40,171 cases have been confirmed and 908 people have died in the country. The U.K. has confirmed four further cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the country to eight. (CNBC)
* Factories in China remain shuttered as some regions extend shutdowns (CNBC)
* As virus deaths top SARS, survivor tells of treatment (WSJ)
* Sen. Bernie Sanders remains at the top of the Democratic field in a new NBC News/Marist poll of tomorrow’s New Hampshire primary. Sanders gets 25% of likely Democratic primary voters in the poll, while former Mayor Pete Buttigieg receives support from 21%. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who had a dismal showing in the Iowa caucuses, comes in at 13%. (CNBC)
* Biden predicts he will ‘take a hit’ in New Hampshire primary after ‘gut punch’ in Iowa (CNBC)
* Mike Bloomberg is the only Democrat to top Trump in Gallup poll of small business owners (CNBC)
* The Iowa Democratic Party allocated delegates based on the results of last week’s Iowa caucuses, giving Buttigieg the largest delegate count, followed closely by Sanders, though many news outlets remained unable to declare a winner. Sanders’ campaign plans to ask for a “partial recanvass” of the results of last week’s Iowa caucuses. (NBC News & AP)
* Sen. Josh Hawley is proposing putting the Federal Trade Commission, an independent agency, within the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch. The proposal is likely to raise alarms about removing the independence of a key regulatory body, especially as Democrats have speculated about Attorney General William Barr’s closeness to Trump. (CNBC)
* Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the leader of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union and the expected successor of Angela Merkel, will not run for chancellor. She will also give up the leadership of the CDU in the summer, according to an unnamed source cited by Reuters, setting in motion a party leadership contest. (CNBC)
* L Brands (LB) is nearing a deal to sell its Victoria’s Secret brand to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal that could be announced as soon this week. It’s not clear what role L Brands CEO Les Wexner would have in such a deal, as he’s under mounting pressure due to his ties to the late sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein. (CNBC)
* The federally appointed oversight board in charge of Puerto Rico’s ongoing record debt restructuring saga announced they have come to terms with bondholders of around $35 billion, which accounts for nearly 50% of the bankrupt island’s total debt load. The deal will cut the Commonwealth’s outstanding bond debt from $35 billion to approximately $11 billion. (CNBC)

I watched from the sidelines as I made my slow and secure Theta Gang tendies for too long. I tried to let everyone enjoy the fun, but I had enough.

I bought 30 190 2/14 Calls. I was in this position for less than 30 seconds before MSFT dropped to the fiery tendieless depths at which it currently resides. I’m down and have not been able to achieve a full erection since. 

I reached out to Microsoft directly - https://imgur.com/gallery/2uMYu6i I’m hoping for all of our sakes they can resolve this issue. 

If MSFT touches 190 before close on Thursday, I’ll send the first 3 people to comment $100 dollars.

As more and more people cut the cable, they will have to turn to ROKU's platform, or should I say 'ecosystems' to stream their favorite cable channels and networks. ROKU will take a % of this and be one of the largest in America, since anyone, anywhere with an internet connection can use roku to stream TV. The primary competitor is not other services on the platform, the primary competitor is linear tv - and ROKU has them beat.

**Let's look at some numbers:**

* Roku sells more dedicated streaming devices than perhaps any other company in the world. It’s been estimated that there are more Rokus in US households than there are Fire TVs, Chromecasts, or Apple TVs. Estimates say 40% of all TV's sold are Roku TV's. 
* If you read through [ROKUs dev SDK](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/advertising/roku-advertising-framework.md), you'll see they force their channel partners to use *their* ads taking a cut of all profits and subs made by, FOX, Disney+ etc.
   * *Entertainment firms pay a carriage fee to be on the cable lineup.* Roku has built itself up as an advertising company, getting a cut of the ad revenues from major media partners in exchange for the distribution. 
   * **Roku's 2019 revenues**, **67% of Roku's $1.1 billion in revenues came from ads**. Growing to $1.6 billion in 2020, with the bulk coming from advertising again. Which amounts to the revenue base more than doubling (111% projected growth rate between 2018-2020.
* ROKU's CEO went into a [Mexican standoff with FOX](https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/4623654002) and fucking wonn. The guy has balls, ROKU got the superbowl and cucked FOX.

**Guidance:**

* Millions more to cut their 'cable' in 2020 and pick it back up on ROKU enabled devices and TV's
* ROKU will announce (soon) something with COMCAST 
* 1/2 of Disney subs signed up using Roku 
* Super Bowl

* After a decline that took the major averages well off their Tuesday session highs, U.S. stock futures point to a strong Wednesday open as investors become slightly less concerned about the coronavirus. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq did manage to eke out record closes Tuesday despite the fall from their highs, and both are up in six of the past seven sessions. (CNBC)

* Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) were losing about a quarter of their value in the premarket after the home goods retailer said same-store sales were down a greater-than-expected 5.4% in December and January. The company blamed increased promotional pricing, lower store traffic and issues with inventory management. (Reuters)
* Shares of Lyft (LYFT) were down over 4% in the premarket despite a strong fourth-quarter report.

However, Lyft did not give an update on its profitability timeline as its competitor Uber (UBER) did during its earnings report last week. (CNBC)
* Sen. Bernie Sanders will win New Hampshire’s Democratic primary, NBC News projected, setting him up near the top of a fractured presidential field.

* The flu-like coronavirus that has sickened more than 44,500 people in over two dozen countries now has a name: COVID-19.

* CDC says ‘mix-up’ led to early release of coronavirus patient in California (CNBC)

(CNBC)
Airbnb reportedly lost money last year as costs outpaced revenue, casting doubt on the company’s private valuation and the timing of its planned public debut this year. The home-sharing start-up reportedly lost $322 million over the first nine months of last year.
* Google (GOOGL) today will seek to overturn the first of three hefty EU antitrust fines at Europe’s second-highest court in a landmark case that could determine how EU enforcers take on U.S. tech giants for abuse of market power. In the U.S., the FTC said it will examine prior acquisitions by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. (Reuters & CNBC)

* After a decline that took the major averages well off their Tuesday session highs, U.S. stock futures point to a strong Wednesday open as investors become slightly less concerned about the coronavirus. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq did manage to eke out record closes Tuesday despite the fall from their highs, and both are up in six of the past seven sessions. (CNBC)
* On today’s economic calendar, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will be back on Capitol Hill today, this time before the Senate Banking Committee in the second day of his semi-annual testimony on monetary policy. The Mortgage Bankers Association is out with its weekly report on mortgage applications at 10 a.m. ET, while the Energy Department releases its usual Wednesday look at oil inventories at 10:30 a.m. ET. (CNBC)
* Bitcoin hits highest price this year, above $10,000 as Powell discusses cryptocurrencies (CNBC)
* Powell says Fed ‘closely monitoring’ coronavirus for hit to China and the world (CNBC)
* Earnings reports out before the opening bell include CVS Health (CVS), Molson Coors (TAP), Moody’s (MCO), and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA). After-the-bell reports will come today from Altice US (ATUS), Applied Materials (AMAT), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Equifax (EFX), International Flavors (IFF), Marathon Oil (MRO), MGM Resorts (MGM), Redfin (RDFN), and TripAdvisor (TRIP).
* Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) were losing about a quarter of their value in the premarket after the home goods retailer said same-store sales were down a greater-than-expected 5.4% in December and January. The company blamed increased promotional pricing, lower store traffic and issues with inventory management. (Reuters)
* Shares of Lyft (LYFT) were down over 4% in the premarket despite a strong fourth-quarter report. The company’s earnings beat estimates on revenue and active riders and a lower-than-expected loss per share. However, Lyft did not give an update on its profitability timeline as its competitor Uber (UBER) did during its earnings report last week. (CNBC)
* Sen. Bernie Sanders will win New Hampshire’s Democratic primary, NBC News projected, setting him up near the top of a fractured presidential field. The Vermont senator will edge out former Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota will come in third. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former VP Joe Biden were vying for fourth place as results came in. (CNBC)
* Joe Biden’s donors are divided on his 2020 prospects after New Hampshire, Iowa flops (CNBC)
* Amy Klobuchar’s campaign gets a boost as Biden and Warren fizzle in New Hampshire (CNBC)
* Presidential candidate Andrew Yang dropped out of the 2020 Democratic race after finishing well behind top-tier candidates in the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. Sen. Michael Bennet also dropped out of the race as results started rolling in. (CNBC)
* The flu-like coronavirus that has sickened more than 44,500 people in over two dozen countries now has a name: COVID-19. The new virus that emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan, China, likely originated in bats and then jumped to an “intermediate host” before infecting humans, World Health Organization officials said. (CNBC)
* The coronavirus appears to be sparing one group of people: Kids (CNBC)
* CDC says ‘mix-up’ led to early release of coronavirus patient in California (CNBC)
* Nissan filed a civil lawsuit against former Chairman Carlos Ghosn today, seeking an initial amount of $90 million. The claimed damages are linked to Ghosn’s “breach of fiduciary duty as a company director and his misappropriation of Nissan’s resources and assets,” the Japanese automaker said in a statement. (CNBC)
Airbnb reportedly lost money last year as costs outpaced revenue, casting doubt on the company’s private valuation and the timing of its planned public debut this year. The home-sharing start-up reportedly lost $322 million over the first nine months of last year.
* Google (GOOGL) today will seek to overturn the first of three hefty EU antitrust fines at Europe’s second-highest court in a landmark case that could determine how EU enforcers take on U.S. tech giants for abuse of market power. In the U.S., the FTC said it will examine prior acquisitions by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. (Reuters & CNBC)

f3f280,61,50,wallstreetbets,Roku Earnings Discussion with some shitty DD included. ER after-hours today -- tank or moon?,0.99,1581649839.0,1581621039.0,"Roku has a consensus estimate of:

**EPS**: $-0.14 (+$0.05 y/y). ""Whisper loss"" = (-$0.11)

**Edit: Actual EPS:** -$0.13

**Expected Quarterly Revenue**: ~$392.69m (+42.4% increase y/y). Company guidance last ER for revs was $380m - $396m.

**Edit: Actual quarterly revenue**: $411.2m!

**Expected Active Roku Accounts**: ~35.1m (This is my own estimate.) This would add about 1.8 million accounts for the quarter. I couldn't find an estimate for this, but it's one of their most important metrics and how they make money, so I just assumed 35% growth y/y which is roughly ~8.5% per quarter, which is fairly reasonable for them. The last 2 years they grew these numbers 39% in 2018 and 36% in 2019.

**Edit: Actual account growth**: up *4.6m*! holy shit! 36.9m active currently. 

**Good** things going for Roku this past holiday quarter in no particular order: 

1) **Roku expanded to Brazil in January.** Brazil's Streaming Videos on Demand (SVoD) is growing at a healthy rate. Market research found that Brazilians were the most likely streamers to purchase multiple streaming services, even more than the US or UK's likelihood. I can't find total streaming figures for Brazil as a whole, but Netflix launched in Brazil a few years ago and they currently have 8.5 mil subs there and make ~550m in revs. I stream a lot of liveleak and there is good reason for Brazilians to hide inside and watch Netflix.

2) **Cord cutting has more than tripled and had a record year in 2019 and is accelerating.** Cord cutters shined again this year with a record 6 million people fucking off from cable companies, up from about 4 million last year. Some nerds say it will slow down due to desire for live sports and news but I say those things are just going to be offered on streaming services in the near future because why the fuck wouldn't they? Either way, they will still lose another ~5 million this year. The amount of cord cutters has doubled in just 2 years.

3) **Roku partnered with Walmart to make TV's and sound bars for bottom feeders**: Roku has a few exclusives like a soundbar with built-in Roku OS and some incredibly cheap, large TVs called ""Roku Onn TV's."" 32"" 720p: $99, 40"" 1080p $169, 50"" 4k $249, 58"" 4k for $299. This is in addition to all TCL tv's and other brands. Despite how many of us here aren't poor and don't buy ass brands, the vast majority of America goes to walmart, looks at a TV, see's the inches and res then buys it based on price. No one cares about 50000:1 ratios of bullshit no one understands. No one cares about refresh rates because they're just watching TV. Everyone wants a cheap, big ass TV that runs all their shit on it through no effort of their own. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roku-roku-adds-licensee-brands-145702672.html

4) **Streaming time/hours have increased overall per year and per individual per day**: Additionally the average amount of money eeked out of each person via ads is increasing. ""In the last reported quarter, active accounts surged 36% year over year to 32.3 million. Streaming hours jumped 68% year over year to 10.3 billion. Moreover, ARPU increased 30% to $22.58 (on a trailing 12-month basis)."" Roku themselves has said it breached 10 billion streaming hours in 2019.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roku-report-q4-earnings-factors-142202311.html

5) **Roku acquired DataXu in November 2019**: DataXu (pronounced data-zoo) is a company that developed software to, essentially, get you fuckin paid more by executing better ads in better places to the proper people using AI and research. Roku has previously stated in the last few ER's that their hardware products such as streaming dongles were slowing in growth a bit whereas their ad revenue accounts for roughly 65% of their revenues and is their main focus moving forward. Roku makes the majority of its money from Roku accounts. For each account that accesses an app like Netflix, Roku gets a cut. On top of that Roku can advertise on their home screen which an aggregate for all apps. This brings me to my next point.

6) **Disney+ and Apple TV are both on Roku and launched in November**: As we've all seen lately Disney+ has a whopping ~26.5 million subscribers. Roku doesn't care if those are free subs or not because Roku gets paid either way through the ways I mentioned in point 5. I don't know Apple TV numbers, but Dis and Apple have both stated they plan to have 60-90 million subs globally by 2024. Who wants to pay $300 for a black hockey puck to watch 6 shows on Apple TV when they could just use their Roku? 

**Bad** things going for Roku: 

1) **Their valuation is pretty fuckin high.** They make just shy of $1 billion in revenue per year but their market cap is about ~$16 billion. Their share price grew 300% in 2019 alone and 800% since their IPO in September 2017. That is fuckin berserk. 

2) **Their expenses were increasing higher than expected last ER and may be again**: Roku experienced some headwinds in the area of rising expenses in 2019 which were part of the reason for the tumble last winter. Who knows how this is going to turn out this past quarter. https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/08/roku-stock-may-be-down-but-its-not-out-not-by-a-lo.aspx

3) **Roku had a dispute with Fox right before the Super Bowl**: Some of you may have seen the news that Roku and Fox came to a contract disagreement during renewal just before the Super Bowl and Roku told Fox to kick fuckin rox. A few days before the Super Bowl Roku and Fox came to an undisclosed agreement. There's no way of telling who caved here, who paid what, or who sacrificed what. It could be bad for expenses, lost ad revenue, people saying fuck Roku the day it was announced then not coming back, etc. I'm not sure how relevant this will be in all honesty. 

4) **IV/Premium/Expected move are fuckin berserk**: Roku options are currently pricing in normal-for-Roku ~~+/-15% move~~ edit @ 3:07: +/-17.5% move. The IV on ITM  2/14's is 340%. The IV all the way out in April ITM calls is near 70%. You can and will get *completely* fucked if this doesn't make a huge move and you are OTM as large chunk of the price is IV right now. 

**Summary**: Roku has a very, very good case to continue its growth story this year. Strong Disney+, Apple TV, and general cord cutting and streaming numbers. New locations to sell in. DataXu acquisition should reap them rewards this past Q. All this can be overshadowed by the fact that Roku may not be ""good enough"" with even just one of their metrics. As we've seen time and time again if the guidance is shit, the expenses are unexpected, or there are any kind of manufacturing headwinds, things can get fucky real fastly. 

My position, please no call pussy. https://imgur.com/a/DYVWWZK

**tl;dr:** ""When everyone is ~~digging for gold~~ creating a streaming service, sell ~~shovels~~ neutral aggregate streaming app hardware and ads on it but watch out for IV.""

First week I’ve lost in months, Dropbox wouldn’t drop with the rest of the market. Apparently my account did a lot better than most people around here so I’m going to keep picking up pennies. 

I think the market is going to bounce hard this week so I’m sticking to puts only. Mainly ROKU and PZZA with a LITTLE bit of SPCE for fun. Let me know what you’re selling.

EDIT: If markets are blood red Monday all of this is subject to change, part of the reason why I sell weeklies is because I don’t have to stress over the weekend.

f7m6sl,54,48,wallstreetbets,Iron Butterfly - I dit it on Restoration Hardware (RH) app and you can do it too,0.94,1582367624.0,1582338824.0,"When volatility and theta decay are very high or you think there would be a volatility crush but anticipate stock price would not move much or would be within the expected move,  instead of selling Iron Condor you can sell Iron Butterfly. The great thing about this strategy and other credit strategy is that you really dont depend on direction of stock price. As long as the price is within expected range you would not lose money. However like all other credit strategies your profit is cappedd.  Here's an example of a trade that I opened yesterday and closed today for a 70% profit. 

I anticipated that SPCE might need a breather after this parabolic move. Also it didn't drop below $30 which I thought was a good support after the selloff. When stock was trading at around $35 the IV was almost 300% for today's expiry. I opened the following for $3.8 ish credit. Expected move was $6

Sell Feb 21 35 put /
Sell Feb 21 35 call/
Buy Feb 21 29 put/
Buy Feb 21 41 call

I closed it today after lunch for about $1.4. Here's the screenshot o the trades: https://imgur.com/rV3RrJu ,https://imgur.com/IGUnqiH

Try it. Like all other strategy it will not work all the time but theta decay or iv crush will be on your side. 

Another example (earning ): sold ROKU 120-140-160 Iron Butterfly for $14 right before market close, closed the trade next day 30 min after market opened for around $7.  

If you are a nerd, read here for for details on this strategy : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_butterfly_(options_strategy)

Update: 
This is just an example of one SPCE trade I did. I also traded long and short. This is one of the rare tickers(may be the only one) in which I luckily made money in all trades - long, short, and neutral.

f8v237,34,27,wallstreetbets,RH liquadating shares without giving me notice of a margin call?,0.83,1582595591.0,1582566791.0,"Hey all you RH delinquents,

I've been holding 300 shares of Roku at $155.79 a share, because like you, I am not a smart man. Anywho, I was holding these shades so I could sell covered calls and collect on premium. That was going all fine and dandy until my account got locked back in December, so since then I've just been waiting for my account to be opened again in order to start selling calls again. As you can see, Roku ain't been doing so hot since December, and I'm down bigly. So, during this debacle of Roku downies, I was margin called once about a month or so ago. I deposited 2500 to keep my precious shares. No biggie. Fast forward to just now and I get a notification through the app that 99 shares were sold at 112.xx, a ~4300 dollar loss. I never made this trade. I reach out to support to let them know what happened and how I think I got boned because I was never issued a margin call, and had I known, I would've deposited more to keep my shares. About a half hour after reaching out to support, I get an email from RH that says I was issued a margin call on February 21st. I was never issued this margin call. They didn't email me, they didn't push a notification through the app, and the app never indicated as such. What can I do here?",2020-02-24

Used 30k to buy the dip at 3pm today. Roku has shown some strength while Intel has reached a PE of 12. It either works or it doesn't. After seeing all the gay bears come out of the woodworks predicting a straight line down to -50% spy I decided to inverse WSB and buy the dip. Worst case scenario I use the high IV to sell Roku calls and I still make money, only losing the Intel calls. If everyone could double their money everyday buying spy puts why would anyone still be working? Can't be that easy, just as weak bulls got shaken out, I expect the weak bears to be shaken out on the bounce tomorrow. Volatility Bitches! Be autistic not retarded!

Edit: Intel Calls worked and ROKU didn't, sold both near open and made $50. Good day to be an autist!",2020-02-25

And positions from earlier today: https://imgur.com/gBcrbOt

Now, you're probably asking yourself, how did this autist manage to get a 19,192% return in the last few days? And why didn't they put in more money to become even richer or is OP just that poor?

To answer all those questions, first, you must look into WSB's past. Many of you know the legends of the $NVDA puts guy, the $ROKU puts guy, or u/__Fog__ All of them had one thing in common, weapons grade autism and making small fortunes using FDs. I sought to recreate their success over the last few months by undergoing similar conditions, i.e. very little money and a terrible brokerage like Robinhood. 

Now why did I subject myself to this?

As u/ipa-warrior much more eloquently puts an observation I made several months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fa08kj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_27_2020/fiwgmow/

&amp;amp;amp;gt;I cracked the code on something over the past few months. I noticed that whenever I throw say, 25%+ of my account into one dumb trade, I tend to lose my ass. Comparatively, when I make a relatively small trade, 5%-10% of my portfolio, I'll often close up 50-300%. I would then scream at the monitor as to why I didn't make a ""big play"" when I win.  

And they are absolutely right. Hypothetically, I could have YOLO'd everything and be a multi-millionaire right now, but realistically and truthfully, there is no way I could have done the same thing with everything I have. My emotions would become a very restricting factor. I might panic sell seeing my account lose tens of thousands of dollars in minutes, I might sell too early, or I might just straight up ruin my life clinging to a position. With much smaller amounts that really are nothing to me, I could rid myself of these negative factors and potentially achieve peak WSB autism. 

Thus leads to my current theory and why I achieved such bigly % gains: 

The more inconsequential your deposit amount is, the more restrictive your positions are, and the shittier the brokerage you're using (Robinhood violated Regulation T, got fined for front running customers, and can't even get a 1099 right), the more likely you can FD your way to some bigly gains. 

Exhibit A- My 1-year graph RH graph to display my observation period losing money to FDs attempting to recreate that success: https://imgur.com/Ruf45UU

First spike: Tesla puts April to May 2019 (Didn't go far enough OTM)

Second spike: Roku puts, September 2019 (Didn't reinvest my bigly gains into more ROKU puts, which would have outdone the legendary ROKU puts guy). 

Decline between second spike and now: FDs on a multiple stocks. No hits. Kept depositing less and less money even though I was trying to mirror my positions in TD. This did not work since I was trying to mirror an account that is much larger and can easily absorb losses, which fell into the gambler’s fallacy.

Third spike (now): Looking for the frothiest stock valuations to buy OTM puts on for quick profits, especially valuation bubbles which will be the biggest winners imo

Thank you for coming to my TED Talks. 

TLDR; Autism + FD = More Tendies

So as SPY looks for more downside the stocks that tumbled the first time will again. And one of the biggest bouncers/illiquid stocks is Roku. Not to mention if we do end up setting a new low I assume most tech boomers who are stuck bag-holding will capitulate.

We are a travel company, so this obviously isnt a surprise. However, what I can tell you is that the amount of cash on our balance sheet(not gonna link, its public info, my only hint will be that we trade on the asx and lost 80% of our value in the last month and trading is still halted for our stock) is 70% client cash. This means we collected it from customers but owe it to our suppliers and vendors. It means we report that as cash on hand but never actually realize it ourselves.

This illustrates how fucked many companies are. Even if they were solvent. All it takes is a few months without revenue and these companies cannot stay above water. No matter how much money any government throws at these corporations, it will not matter, because there is no customer base.

Do not fall for this bull trap. All the stimulus has done is stop the bleeding, it has not resolved the problem, and it never will.

Everything is gapping today with the market, yesterday turned out to be a strong day maybe today we see some follow through. Wait for good patterns with defined risk/reward before entering. Business as usual. Good luck trading.",2020-04-07

Markets gapping up today and most stocks are gapping with it. SPY nearest resistance around 290.

Most of the time big gaps fade at open before pushing higher, the last few gaps have held though. Looks like this is buying before earnings which will happen next week.

Stocks Rally on “Not Terrible” Bank Earnings
 
Oil Fails Again, Trades Sub-$20.00
 
 
Today was a winner from last night’s futures action and the “Less than feared” reports from JPM and WFC.  It didn’t take long for those two to reverse and head lower.  This market cares absolutely nothing for the reality of the current situation.  We have a president who thinks he’s a king and will do whatever he wants, whenever he wants and will reopen the economy on command.  His base may believe that, but it is 180 degrees opposite of what the science says.  The DJIA finished +558.99 (2.39%), NASDAQ +323.32 (3.96%), S&P 500 +84.43 (3.06%), the Russell +25.29 (2.09%) and the DJ Transports +140.77 (1.75%, again a laggard).  The DJIA was 24:6 Up on the day with AAPL the big gainer +94 DPs, followed by HD +59, MSFT +56, UNH +47, and JNJ as standout who provided forward guidance and went against the trend and raised their dividend.  BA was the big loser on news that it had 150 orders 737MAX cancelled and fell 43 DPs with JPM and AXP also losers.  BTW, just an aside, there were 21 splits listed for the balance of April, ALL OF THE REVERSES.  These included several of the leveraged ETF names but also included Chesapeake Energy (CHK) with a 1:200 in order to stay on the NYSE.  Market internals were about average with NYSE A/D 3:1 and NADSAQ 2.4:1.  Volume was a touch below average.  Consumer discretionary and information tech were strong with financials and energy weak.
 
 
Our “open forum” on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It’s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we’ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled “How to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,” over the long weekend.  I think it’s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.  The link is

Tonight’s closing comment video (new equipment)  https://youtu.be/vK9cZB5oYu0
SECTORS: The FAANG names were strong across the board (see below) and bonds were mostly unchanged to a touch lower.  On the small cap biopharma group, which has a new name popping up every day we had Sonnet Bio (SONN) another one of those wonderful reverses (1:10 and 1:26) trading $10.80 +5.86 preopen and followed by a run to $16.20 before finishing the day $7.99 +3.05 (61.74%) with no news except “trading halted, trading resumed.  MEI Pharma (MEIP) had good news in the receipt of $100MM payment and for its oral, once a day drug for “B-cell malignancies.”  I may be entitled to up to $582MM based on successful development.  The stock traded 2.91 +1.24 (74.8%) preopen and continued to open $3.05, trade up to $3.64 but selloff a bit to close $2.50 +.83 (49.7%).  Last in this group, RedHill Biopharma (RDHL) updated its progress with its drug, Opaganib, approved for compassionate use in Italy and Israel.  The COVID-19 treatment has been very successful.  In Israel, the treatment of just 2 patients demonstrated “measurable clinical improvement within days of treatment initiation.”  Patients needed decreased oxygen requirements, decreased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and increased lymphocyte levels.  One patient was treated in the ICU, considered for intubation and was released within days of treatment.  Although it traded as high as $22.22 in late 2015, it has not been reversed, it traded as low as $3.26 in March and worked its way higher and broke to the upside Monday 4/6 over $5.50 and has continued higher.  It closed today $7.51 +.63 (9.16%) after hitting $8.24.  So, not a one-day wonder, it has moved from $3.26 to $7.51 over the last 2 weeks.
 
Last was ROKU reporting a big gain in revenues this morning.  This Lotto tick from $15 in 2017 to trade $176.55 in (9/19) fell back to $58.22 in March finishing the day $106.53 +9.97 (10.33%), almost doubling in just under a month.  

BIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB +10.82, ABBV +2.88, REGN +7.82, ISRG +20.46 (4.14%), MYL +.29, TEVA +.30, VRTX +12.22 (4.84%), INCY +3.27, ICPT +3.29 LABU +3.10 (11.41%) and IBB $118.55 +4.06 (3.55%).

CANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +.51, CGC +1.02, CRON +.22, GWPH +1.27, ACB - .004, PYX +.16, NBEV +.39, CURLF +.06, KERN +.10 and MJ $11.70 +.25 (2.18%).

 
DEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +15.04, RTX +3.91, GD +1.90, TXT +.06, NOC +9.94, BWXT +.65, TDY +6.27, and ITA $154.67 +4.04 (2.68%).
  
RETAIL: was HIGHER with M +.02, JWN -.39, KSS +.24, DDS -1.16, JCP -.01, WMT +3.79, TGT +3.70, TJX +2.37, RL +.53, UAA +.41, LULU +5.93, TPR +.61, CPRI +1.38 (10.58%), and XRT $34.75 +1.47 (4.42%).
 
 
FAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with several big moves vs. the overall market, with GOOGL +54.59, AMZN +116.13 (5.35%), AAPL +14.15 (5.18%), FB +3.42, NFLX +15.51, NVDA +14.64 (5.43%), TSLA +61.70 (9.48%), BABA +5.74, BIDU +2.98, BA -6.33, CAT +2.71, DIS +2.60 and XLK $89.10 +3.71 (4.34%).
  
FINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -1.73, JPM -2.36, BAC -.14, MS +.29, C -1.53, PNC -1.46, AIG +.15, TRV +3.57, AXP -1.94, and XLF $22.75 +.22 (.98%).
 
OIL, $20.11 -2.30. Oil was lower overnight and by the NY open this morning the best it could do was $21.92 -39 and started lower until it fell in the late afternoon to trade 19.95 before a small rally to close just over $20.00.  Tonight, it is up $ .75.  Tonight’s closing comment on the front page discusses this situation and the position we took in SCO.  Stocks were lower with the XLE $38.80 unchanged. This is a video update I made midday.  https://youtu.be/40obqKxYVek
  
METALS, GOLD: $1,768.90 +7.50. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 today. Today was a major move to the upside and the close is the highest since September 2012 and sets up a move towards the highs at $1,800 from 2011.
 
BITCOIN: closed $6950 +140. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we’d have to test 67.50 and today we hit 6550 before turning back up.  While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.30 +.05 today.
 
Tomorrow is another day.

Flat open, market gaping down after nearing resistance. Ideally we would like to see some consolidation within the market before heading into earnings next week. This will help charts set up more. Airlines are gapping pre market, I only put 1 on my list because I feel like it had the best chart. If they decide to move they all have room to the upside. The watch list is lacking due to the market being flat, things should pick up next week after Alcoa reports. Before you enter any trades have a defined risk to reward with entry, target, and stop pre planned in case price moves against you. Good luck trading.",2020-04-15

Market slightly gapping up, still with very few stocks that have catalyst and most stocks are gapping with the market. If the market fades off it's likely that most gap ups will fade with it at open. SPY sitting just under the 50 day moving average which is at 287.74 but still holding above the 272 pivot level from last year so it is a good sign.  Things should start picking up next week as we get into earnings season, until then it's business as usual. Only take solid trades with entry, stops, and targets planned before entering trades. If price goes against you, always have a plan to exit with small losses so you don't get wiped out in 1 trade. Good luck trading",2020-04-16
g2u7xv,24,35,wallstreetbets,FOMO -> stocks only go up,0.84,1587123382.0,1587094582.0,"Hello there, my smooth-brained peers,

It feels like January 2019: the market is booming (up 30% in the last month), stocks only go up, there is some weird beerflu going around, but it's no big deal.

Why is that?  Investors are happy.  New cases seem to be declining, and the bottom is in.  Anecdotal evidence from other autists, friends, and family alike all suggest that everyone wants to get in the market.  The past three years of this bull run put the market on easy mode for everyone.  You could have literally rolled dice to pick tickers, and you would get insta profits.  The pussys on the sideline have been waiting for their entry in the market.  The chose the last few weeks to hop on J-Powell's train to tendie heaven, hence the rise in stonk.

It seems like anyone with half a brain knows that corona is actually a bad thing and will have a lasting effect on the world economy.  They are on the sideline.  The only people buying are FOMOing into obvious quarantine plays (AMZN, NFLX, ROKU) and bringing up the whole market on low volume.

The very people supporting our current pump are weak-minded and paper handed.  MMs, hedge funds, the big boys all know this.  We are in for another rug pull. I don't know when, but when your dipshit friend who asked you last week how to do a call option starts panic selling when he sees his first -3% day...F

I think the story goes something like the top is when shoeshine boy asks how to get in the market.  Our shoeshine boy is Cam who is doing a 1000 to 1000000 challenge and the top is 292 tomorrow at 11:34pm.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR: market is driven by normies FOMOing

jk stocks only go up, bears are gay, mods are too

&#x200B;

Market slightly gapping up, still with very few stocks that have catalyst and most stocks are gapping with the market. If the market fades off it's likely that most gap ups will fade with it at open. SPY sitting just under the 50 day moving average which is at 287.74 but still holding above the 272 pivot level from last year so it is a good sign.  Things should start picking up next week as we get into earnings season, until then it's business as usual. Only take solid trades with entry, stops, and targets planned before entering trades. If price goes against you, always have a plan to exit with small losses so you don't get wiped out in 1 trade. Good luck trading",2020-04-16

First post ever. Totally new here. I started trading with options these past few months and got lucky way too many times. Just a few days ago I opened the worst and most dangerous trades since I bought my first stock and now **I am in deep trouble**.

Here is the situation:

In the last week or two I sold dozens of naked calls.

**ROKU**: sold 5 naked calls (cost-basis -$3.75k, market value price -$16.8k). at strike price $100 expiring June 15

**TSLA**: sold 6 naked calls (cost basis -$12.9k, market value -$-72.7k) at strike price $710 expiring May 15

**SPCE**: sold 50 naked calls (cost basis -$5.9k, market value -$.15.8k) at strike price $20.5 expiring May 22

What should I do? I can post the Greeks here too if anyone wants/needs to see them.

Any advice is appreciated 🙏",2020-04-17

g542sx,75,103,wallstreetbets,Activision is going to smash $83 and hit new ATH in three weeks,0.93,1587454771.0,1587425971.0,"I am going to share with you why ATVI is going to absolutely smash their ATH back in Q4 2018 of $83, in which the stock price lost almost half it's value by end of Q1 2019. The stock closed at $66 today, and Activision reports earnings 5/5.

Activision is in a much better position now than they were in Q4 2018 due to their ability to switch entirely to a high-margin, software driven sales model, reduce capital expenditure while increasing top line revenue, and significantly increase ARPU through seasonal DLC such as battle pass and cosmetic items. Activision was able to capitalize on this successfully as these did not provide a competitive advantage in COD multiplayer/Warzone and had high production value (weapon skins, character skins, calling cards, emblems, etc.)

——

**Record Levels of Player Engagement due to federal stay-at-home orders.** 

COD player count nearly doubled in just one month (mid March to April). This type of growth is unprecedented and since the stay at home orders were put in place, the player base has grown at faster rate since launch in October 2019. Warzone is free yes, but how many of those free customers do you think purchased a battle pass or cosmetic DLC? Not all yes, but surely a significant amount. Activision may likely see microtransaction revenue double assuming a doubling in the player base.

**Strong Cash Position and Continued Growth in Gaming**

Activision is well positioned to take on the coronavirus due to their strong cash position, which has been growing every fiscal quarter. Activision ended 2019 with a cash position of $5.8B. In fact, they will only benefit from this more as people continue to stay at home and continue gaming. Stocks like Netflix and Roku have seen major hype this past month, however the market seems to have forgotten about the gaming market, which I will dive into next.

**Crossplay capability greatly enhances player enjoyment due to increased social factor**

The console and PC gaming markets are two completely different consumer segments, resulting in friends being distanced from gaming due to two competing gaming platforms. By allowing console and PC players to play together, this would likely result in increased growth in sales due to players now being able to play with more friends. This would then result in an increase in play time as players tend stay online longer with friends than alone. All of this factors in to Activision's ""extrinsic value"" or customer loyalty and stickiness. Games are able to efficiently capture and capitalize on customer's emotions and Activision's marketing team is top notch in capturing the market's attention and keeping it for the long term.

**Strong Product Line-up**

I won't spend too much time on this one. World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Diablo, Hearthstone, Call of Duty, etc. These are some of the biggest names in PC gaming in which Activision will retain their loyal customer base resulting in steady and consistent revenue in years to come.

Ultimately, the market has not caught on to this yet. Media has only been referring to big name stocks like Netflix, Roku, Grubhub, Wayfair, etc. in stay at home stocks but they are completely forgetting about the gaming world. ATVI, EA, and TTWO are well positioned to benefit from the worldwide crisis. 

ATVI call with any of the following strikes depending on your risk/reward ratio. These are on sale right now: $70, $75, $80 5/15",2020-04-20

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 4th, 2020.

# **April’s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday’s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.
*****
> The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.
*****
> Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.
*****
> “I think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. “I think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.”
*****
> Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
*****
> But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. “If they go well that’s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that’ll be a blow to confidence,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.
*****
> # Best April in years
Stocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.
*****
> Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. “Now there’s not that much to look forward to,” he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.
*****
> “We had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,” said Stovall. “It’s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. … Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April’s gains.” The S&P 500′s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.
*****
> # Virus economy
Economists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.
*****
> Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. “This is all a stab in the dark,” he said.
*****
> “I think it’s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,” said Stanley. “But I do think you’re going to see steady improvement. I think you’re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.”
*****
> Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.
*****
> Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.
*****
> But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.
*****
> “I think it could spook people,” said Schumacher. “In the markets, we’ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.”
*****
> Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday’s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it’s unclear how quickly it can recover.
*****
> “There are people who will go and do things as soon as they’re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,” he said. “I do think expecting we’re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.”
*****
> Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.
*****
> # A new 20-year bond
The Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter.
*****
> The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus.
*****
> “The supply announcement we think is significant because you’re going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,” said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter.
*****
> Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt.

# US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession

> It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren’t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.

> The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit’s preliminary Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.

> Today’s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing—the so-called official PMI—provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg’s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

> But that’s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.

> The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.

> “The more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “Given the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we’ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.”

> The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter—potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&P 500 earnings).

> Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.

# Global Central Banks All In

> The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.

> “The central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “And the market is seeing it. It’s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-Chart-20-04-30.png?ssl=1))**

> Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity

> The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 – 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.

> The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.

> The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.

> With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim “Don’t fight the Fed” alive even in an age of zero rates.

# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition

> Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear “Sell in May.” But when exactly in May is the “best” time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May’s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.

# This is Still an Election Year

> We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.

> Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dce5f19dd2ccfc16a4e0795dd5a11f68/8033867962439c40-45/s500x750/8543ffd66d568035ffa681a3d72b861c8f84b996.jpg))**

> Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.

> Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman’s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.

# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot

> The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two—Utilities and Financials—above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.

> When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.

> The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 4th, 2020.

# **April’s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday’s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.
*****
> The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.
*****
> Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.
*****
> “I think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. “I think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.”
*****
> Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
*****
> But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. “If they go well that’s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that’ll be a blow to confidence,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.
*****
> # Best April in years
Stocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.
*****
> Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. “Now there’s not that much to look forward to,” he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.
*****
> “We had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,” said Stovall. “It’s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. … Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April’s gains.” The S&P 500′s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.
*****
> # Virus economy
Economists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.
*****
> Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. “This is all a stab in the dark,” he said.
*****
> “I think it’s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,” said Stanley. “But I do think you’re going to see steady improvement. I think you’re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.”
*****
> Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.
*****
> Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.
*****
> But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.
*****
> “I think it could spook people,” said Schumacher. “In the markets, we’ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.”
*****
> Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday’s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it’s unclear how quickly it can recover.
*****
> “There are people who will go and do things as soon as they’re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,” he said. “I do think expecting we’re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.”
*****
> Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.
*****
> # A new 20-year bond
The Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter.
*****
> The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus.
*****
> “The supply announcement we think is significant because you’re going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,” said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter.
*****
> Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt.

# US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession

> It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren’t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.

> The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit’s preliminary Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.

> Today’s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing—the so-called official PMI—provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg’s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

> But that’s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.

> The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.

> “The more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “Given the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we’ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.”

> The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter—potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&P 500 earnings).

> Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.

# Global Central Banks All In

> The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.

> “The central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “And the market is seeing it. It’s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-Chart-20-04-30.png?ssl=1))**

> Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity

> The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 – 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.

> The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.

> The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.

> With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim “Don’t fight the Fed” alive even in an age of zero rates.

# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition

> Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear “Sell in May.” But when exactly in May is the “best” time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May’s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.

# This is Still an Election Year

> We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.

> Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.

> Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.

> Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman’s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.

# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot

> The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two—Utilities and Financials—above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.

> When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.

> The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 4th, 2020.

# **April’s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday’s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.
*****
> The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.
*****
> Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.
*****
> “I think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. “I think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.”
*****
> Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
*****
> But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. “If they go well that’s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that’ll be a blow to confidence,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.
*****
> # Best April in years
Stocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.
*****
> Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. “Now there’s not that much to look forward to,” he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.
*****
> “We had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,” said Stovall. “It’s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. … Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April’s gains.” The S&P 500′s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.
*****
> # Virus economy
Economists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.
*****
> Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. “This is all a stab in the dark,” he said.
*****
> “I think it’s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,” said Stanley. “But I do think you’re going to see steady improvement. I think you’re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.”
*****
> Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.
*****
> Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.
*****
> But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.
*****
> “I think it could spook people,” said Schumacher. “In the markets, we’ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.”
*****
> Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday’s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it’s unclear how quickly it can recover.
*****
> “There are people who will go and do things as soon as they’re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,” he said. “I do think expecting we’re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.”
*****
> Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.
*****
> # A new 20-year bond
The Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter.
*****
> The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus.
*****
> “The supply announcement we think is significant because you’re going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,” said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter.
*****
> Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt.

# US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession

> It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren’t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.

> The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit’s preliminary Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.

> Today’s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing—the so-called official PMI—provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg’s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

> But that’s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.

> The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.

> “The more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “Given the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we’ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.”

> The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter—potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&P 500 earnings).

> Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.

# Global Central Banks All In

> The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.

> “The central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “And the market is seeing it. It’s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.”

> Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity

> The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 – 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.

> The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.

> The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.

> With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim “Don’t fight the Fed” alive even in an age of zero rates.

# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition

> Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear “Sell in May.” But when exactly in May is the “best” time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May’s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.

# This is Still an Election Year

> We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.

> Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.

> Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.

> Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman’s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.

# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot

> The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two—Utilities and Financials—above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.

> When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.

> The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.

MRNA earnings can literally green fuck the whole market. PTON looks good and I bet their orders are through the roof! Who can pay for it, who could pay for a Tesla, rich white people thats who. I would know, all my dumbass friends own one and will not shut the fuck up about it.

PTON calls on the selloff this evening, MRNA calls anytime here. I'm also biting into CRWD BA and SNAP cause they look good, and flipped my MSFT 182.5 C into a 185 C and cash. Roll out ya shit boyssss

also ROKU can go crazy but I'd buy spreads, that shit is EXPENSIVE.

edit: hey look, it started selling off. Might be more profit taking before close.

gfd2dg,44,71,wallstreetbets,"Don't play earnings, play earnings players",0.9,1588907646.0,1588878846.0,"With the craziness of the earnings season and surprising behaviour of the market at earnings reports (looking at you, $LYFT and $CVNA), it has come to my attention that for safer plays it might be a better idea to single out companies that are expected to move a lot during earnings next week and buy options in advance.

Let's look at where this has already happened - today at bell, $ROKU 137c 5/8 was worth \~$5.6, and look at it now with $8.9. With nearly zero risk, you could have achieved gains in the vicinity of 100% on just buying the call at open and selling at close. It also happened with $ATVI earlier in the week, but I've not held a position until earnings date, though it still turned out to be profitable with the market reacting well to $ATVI's earnings beat.

I know what you will say now - $ATVI AND $ROKU will smash earnings one hundred percent, you're a fucking retard, go back to r/investing. You could then again look at the expected return of 100% DAILY - keeping this up for a week by selling at open and rolling over towards the next likely ticker you're looking at gains of 1600%, provided you stick with reinvesting the entriety of your original sum.

Chances are, $ROKU WILL smash earnings. But on the off-chance there's an Amazon around the corner, it would be a safer, and not a lot less profitable a bet to be making.

Positions: $CAH 5/15 $48c

**P. S.** It had occurred to me after u/Edwinbuddy mentioned it that not everyone has daytrading privileges. In case you're facing the same problem, you can open a position a day earlier than the day before earnings, and sell on earnings day (or on previous day close) without burning day trades.

**P. P. S.** Apparently $ROKU fucked up and went down 7% AH, seems like this strategy got one more ticker into its confirmation bias gig.",2020-05-07

gh7190,84,65,options,Getting out of the habit of gambling with short term OTM options,0.85,1589165300.0,1589136500.0,"So I’m part of the “millennial” crowd that got into trading during quarantine and I’ve been following WSB, which I know is looked down upon here for good reason, as it’s basically gambling, no better than roulette. Mostly OTM options with short expiry, two weeks or less, mostly playing earnings. So very high risk gambles. I’ve actually had some beginners luck and made some good plays, but also gotten burned. I’m up $300 (16%) all time. I hit it big on ATVI calls, and a few days ago I was up big time ($1700) on ROKU and NET calls, but decided to hold through earnings and ended up losing almost all of that, bringing me back down from +1700 to +300 overnight.

These plays are “exciting” in the way that gambling is exciting, and provides instant gratification since you know within a week or so whether you’ve made (or lost) money. Also by going OTM, the premiums are cheap and I only have to drop $100 or less on the contract, and that’s the most I can lose, as opposed to buying a more expensive premium where I can lose upwards of $1000 if the market goes the other way.

I want to learn more about more sensible strategies instead of always gambling on earnings. From what I’ve read, there are spreads (credit & debit), covered calls, iron condor, etc. As far as I know, these strategies involve longer dated plays, which is bad for someone impatient like me because if I put 30% of my bankroll on a play and it starts losing money, I get freaked and start looking for an exit, even though it might come back. I hate putting myself though that in-between period where I have to watch my account getting lower and lower by the hour/day. But I realize that patience is key and I’m willing to do that if it makes me more money in the end.

Basically, I want to limit my potential losses, even if that means I don’t make as much profit. I’d rather make money slow and steady and not have to worry as much about losing money. So instead of making risky plays that could profit me several hundred dollars, but also lose me several hundred, I would rather make $30 per play but only risk $30 (or less) per play, if that makes sense.

Can anyone point me to a good, easy to understand for beginners, guide to these strategies? Kind of an ELI5 type explanation? And do you have any suggestions for strategies?

Thanks for any help!!",2020-05-08

After my monstrous [WIX play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghn8sl/wix_breakout_and_pre_earnings_play/) (1500%+ returns), many have been asking for my next play. Well, at long last, here it is: Elastic NV, ticker symbol **$ESTC**. Before I get into it, shout out to u/Frostyfragzz for his fine [DD post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnwtjt/estc_soon_to_rise_an_unrecognized_beneficiary_of/) that put Elastic back on my radar. I first looked into Elastic circa July 2019 and have been monitoring ever since. Today, I’m going to build on Frosty’s thesis and lay out a case for why Elastic not only has strong long-term fundamentals, but also short term tailwinds and a compelling technical setup.

**TL;DR: Long ESTC because this is one of the times in the stock market when other people’s trash will become your treasure. ESTC has been the trash, and will soon be the treasure. The company is misunderstood, mispriced, and undervalued compared to its peers (I can’t help but laugh at saying that a P/S of 16.1 is “undervalued”, but we’re here to make money, not be Warren Buffet). In short, we’re about to see some serious price discovery. History, whether you liked it in school or not, is telling you that ESTC will run up to earnings, and likely after. The all-time high ($104.1) is in the sights.**

**Summary of Frosty’s DD**

If you haven’t read [Frosty’s DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnwtjt/estc_soon_to_rise_an_unrecognized_beneficiary_of/), go ahead and do that. Or just read my summary 🤷‍♂. In any case, there is no point in me merely repeating his (wonderful) points.

*Summary Starts Here*

Marc Cohodes (awesome short-seller and all-around cool guy even though Frosty spelled his first name wrong, you should check him out) was bullish on Camping World ($CWH) in late April. The stock went from \~$8 then to \~$20 today. The reason? Marc was able to “look at an obvious shift (quarantine) in behavior and identify a non-obvious beneficiary (RV / outdoor equipment sellers).”

With Elastic (ESTC), Frosty is doing just that. The obvious shift in behavior is that COVID 19 has radically sped up a paradigm shift already in motion: the shift of companies, workers, and consumers to online. The non-obvious beneficiary is Elastic, a company that enables advanced search features on apps and websites (think matching you to your Uber, or enabling you find matches on Tinder).

Now, why is Elastic a (relatively) “non-obvious” beneficiary? Two reasons.

1. It should benefit tremendously from increased web and app usage, which means higher revenue not in spite of COVID, but because of it (Elastic as a company is better because of COVID)
2. Unlike SHOP, TWLO, FSLY, MDB, DDOG, Elastic’s stock is still a ways away from its all-time high.

Now, let's talk about the product, offered through a “freemium” model: a consortium of open-source software offerings with search, logging, security, and analytics use cases. Elastic has some heavyweight customers: Shopify, Uber, Stack Overflow, Twilio, and over 32% of the Fortune 500, among others. Some of Elastic’s primary competitors are: Splunk and Amazon (which doesn’t turn out to be a big deal, much like how Prime Video hasn’t killed off Roku, and Disney Plus hasn’t destroyed Netflix). Combine Elastic’s product functionality with their penetration (freemium model, remember?) and exceedingly high DBNER of > 130% (net expansion rate, so how much more existing customers spend every year) and you have a company that appears poised to thrive in the world of COVID.

In terms of revenue (this seemed to be where some were confused in the comments of Frosty’s post), Elastic thrives in COVID in 2 ways: 1) existing paying customers spend more because of increased usage, and 2) existing non-paying users make the switch and become paying customers because of, again, increased usage.

What does all the above mean in terms of numbers? Elastic has been growing revenue at \~60% (with accelerating SaaS revenue), and yet still trades at EV/S multiples that are far below competitors (and even Elastic’s past self), because of unfounded competition worries and worries over high R&D spend (which is actually a good thing long term, think early Amazon).

The play? Take advantage of Elastic’s strong fundamentals in the COVID world, its unfairly low (relative) multiples, and the fact that the stock price should not just recover to pre-COVID levels but exceed them (like almost all other cloud tech guys, many of which are at ATHs, ex. MDB, FSLY, DDOG) by their upcoming earnings on 6/3. Buy calls.

*Summary Ends Here*

**The Business Model (How Elastic Actually Makes Money), and Why COVID Plays Right Into It**

While Frosty did a great job at providing a high-level overview of what Elastic does, it seems as though there was some confusion in the comments with regard to how Elastic actually makes money (business model) and how COVID ties into it. Let’s clear that up.

You can sum up Elastic’s model up in a couple words: *the freemium model*. What does that mean? They give away a free version of their software offerings, and then charge for additional features/more advanced offerings. On some level, this is similar to free-to-play video games with microtransactions (like Clash of Clans or COD Warzone).

So how does that work in practice? First of all, unlike competitors like Splunk, Elastic is open source. For all the non-software engineers out there, the term open source is defined as the following (and I’m quoting here from [Google himself](https://www.google.com/search?q=open+source+definition&oq=open+source+defin&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l6.2733j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)): “denoting software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.” Essentially, Elastic allows developers (and their target audience *is* techies, which explains their tech-oriented CEO and how it’s not super obvious/easy to understand what they do) to download their ELK stack for free, and to modify it however they see fit. This has two benefits. First of all, it means that Elastic is a much more flexible and customizable offering than its full-service, more rigid (and oftentimes more expensive) competitors (like Splunk). Second, by prioritizing adoption, Elastic has built up an enormous user base, with more than 350M downloads as of 2018, and likely somewhere closer to .5-1B today.

Seems simple right? Like free-to-play games, all Elastic has to do now is convince its free users to give it money. The “microtransactions” of its software offerings are simply added features and support. There are a number of paid offerings that I won’t go into detail here, but suffice it to say that they have cloud-based SaaS offerings as well as on-premise offerings. Now, why would an existing user of Elastic’s free open source software decide to become a paying customer? Primarily for one reason: once usage increases to a certain level (either because “search is the product” (Scott Miller) or because of sheer volume), having the best tools and support available is more than worth the relatively small cost. Furthermore, once a user becomes a paying Elastic customer, the vast majority of the customer’s cost is based on resources used, not by host, endpoint, or ingests. So more usage = more revenue.

Here is some visualization of their pricing models:

[Cloud SaaS:](https://preview.redd.it/ihuduvvhm2151.png?width=2510&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8cf39edf2979fd9b2a5ec962166c120c031fc2b)

[Stand-alone On-premises:](https://preview.redd.it/cazfu8psm2151.png?width=1139&format=png&auto=webp&s=32edf568f7cc24f1a773cc138d1f1a6e7bf76a1c)

*Now, understanding the business model is great and all, but what does any of this have to do with COVID?*

It’s actually quite simple. 1) COVID will make existing paying customers spend more. 2) COVID will force more non-paying users to become paying customers.

Why?

Starting with #1, we have already seen (from released earnings) that COVID has resulted in massive usage increases in some of Elastic’s largest paying customers--such as Shopify, Twilio, and Tinder. More usage = more resources used = higher cost = higher revenue.

For #2, COVID is radically speeding up the rate at which business and consumption moves online. As business’ online presence become increasingly mission critical, the services that Elastic provides--search, observability, and security--also become mission critical.  What this does is push more existing non-paying users past the level where having the best of class tools and support more than pays for itself.

**Splunk’s Earnings and How It Ties Into Elastic**

Splunk reported earnings after the close this last Thursday, 5/21. Why is this relevant? Although Splunk is not Elastic’s closest competitor (that honor goes to Lucidworks’ Apache Solr, which I talk about below in the “Risks, Concerns, and Counterarguments” section), the two’s stock prices are quite correlated and Splunk’s earnings provide a hint at what could lie ahead for Elastic. Note that Splunks’s bread and butter is the observability category while Elastic’s is search.

While Splunk’s overall quarterly revenue was only up 2% QoQ to $434.1M, its cloud services segment revenue for the quarter was up 80.7%, to $112.2M! It is highly likely that we see something similar with Elastic’s earnings: cloud (SaaS) revenue will likely continue its acceleration, becoming an ever-large part of revenue. What's also important about Splunk’s earnings was the market’s reaction. Even though revenue missed expectations by $9.53M (2.2%), after a brief dip after hours, the stock rallied strongly, set a new all-time high, and finished the next trading day up 12.73%. Even if Elastic’s non-SaaS revenue underperforms (which I don’t believe will happen), Splunk’s earnings tell us that blowout SaaS numbers will still likely result in stock price appreciation. Assuming Elastic crushes earnings on all fronts (the thesis), markets are indicating that a dramatic surge in Elastic’s stock could be in the cards.

Note: this all assumes the run-up doesn’t occur before earnings, in which case it becomes a bit more complicated (I talk about this below).

[SPLK 20-Day Chart:](https://preview.redd.it/6jr0e8z8n2151.png?width=1816&format=png&auto=webp&s=52ec5f3c565d1c6767cc0053f01cf0059e3f7b64)

**The Technicals and What History Is Trying To Tell You**

Let’s take a step back and approach this from a slightly different angle for a little bit. While the majority of this post so far (and Frosty’s) focused on fundamentals and the post-earnings thesis, there is a strong technical case to be made that the entire run-up to a new all-time high could occur *before* earnings.

Here’s why. For a large part of this earnings season, one theme has dominated: tech companies have run up to earnings. As we go deeper into earnings season, this has only become more true. Apart from general market movement, I believe that this is due to a simple realization--that some companies (and much of tech) are not just alive, but better off because of COVID. The farther we go into earnings season, the more proof there is of this truth.

There are numerous examples of this playing out. Wix is one, for instance. After the case for Wix was validated (in part) by Shopify's earnings, it hit an all-time high before earnings, and then continued to soar after earnings.

[WIX YTD-Chart:](https://preview.redd.it/7vsz3khon2151.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&s=86facb1accafa164c685e3ff390418d0ed55ec4a)

Shopify is another example that, after being validated by Amazon's earnings and common sense, set a new all-time high well before its earnings date. It continued to soar after.

[SHOP YTD-Chart:](https://preview.redd.it/kchs6cmwn2151.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=aacc976ff38cf4f8e32f6cbe4691ea7c487fe90e)

Since the market has already seen a number of cloud tech companies performing better because of COVID and setting new all-time-highs (DDOG, SPLK, TWLO, etc.), the odds that ESTC sets a new all-time high before earnings are quite good. Remember that markets are not a real-time gauge of value; in the short-run at least, they’re a voting machine of people trying to decide what they *think* a company will be worth in the future. Markets generally try to price current sentiment in as quickly as possible (hence why most significant market moves lately have happened quite quickly with lots of nothing in between). With Splunk’s earnings acting as a tailwind--and with Friday’s near 10% move for ESTC lending momentum--it is entirely possible that Elastic hits, or at least approaches, a new all-time-high before earnings.

Now, whether it happens before earnings or after, there is a strong technical case for a new ATH.

[ESTC 1-Year Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ubxbosy4o2151.png?width=1336&format=png&auto=webp&s=7908f063539a3a2a91e8804d2343935f367eb9a2)

Looking at ESTC’s 1 year chart, Elastic recently broke out of a downward channel it had been in since setting its all-time-high in July 2019. It also broke through two key resistances, most notably its pre-COVID level, with strong volume. Its accumulation distribution indicator is at its highest level since October of 2019, and increasing (as Frosty stated, ESTC was one of the top 10 stocks that hedge funds moved into this quarter).  From a momentum standpoint, Elastic’s chart looks solid: still relatively early in a new wave up, with funds flowing in from big money. A run-up to earnings here is very high conviction, and, depending on what the stock does until earnings and the fundamentals presented, momentum could continue after earnings.

**Risks, Concerns, and Counterarguments (For All the Nonbelievers)**

*1. COVID 19 has affected the cash flow of a wide variety of businesses. For businesses (especially small and medium-sized) that are strapped for cash and looking to cut costs, would Elastic’s suite of products be some of the first costs to be cut? Even if they are not, is it actually likely that new businesses would start paying additional money to use their services, right now?*

From a fundamental side, I’d say this is the strongest argument against the thesis. But I would argue it doesn’t hold merit for a couple reasons. First of all, Elastic has a relatively small number of paying customers compared to its install base, and these paying customers tend to be the very big guys (lots unicorns and the Fortune 500). Some of these companies (where search often “is the product”) have actually benefited from the pandemic and seen increased usage, so they would spend more, if anything. Even for paying customers that have been harmed by the pandemic, the overwhelming majority will be reducing spend on traditional items and moving more money into online operations (ex. anything retail). Offering the best online experience for customers will be paramount here, so if anything, even these companies will spend more. For the last part of the question, I would argue that COVID 19 will serve as a sort of tipping point for companies to jumpstart their online operations. Whether that is stores or other offerings, the sheer increase in web traffic is likely to push many non-paying users past the point I referenced above in the business model section: where usage numbers make the cost benefit analysis for having the best tools and support favorable. Lastly, I think other cloud tech companies’ earnings have shown that the concern, while valid in some areas, has been dwarfed by the sheer scale of the move to online and the acceleration of a paradigm shift in how the world does business and consumption.

*2. What about competitors such as Lucidworks’ Apache Solr (and Fusion)?*

While Frosty primarily compared Elastic to Splunk and Amazon’s version of Elasticsearch, I believe that Elastic’s closest competitor is Lucidworks’ Apache Solr (open source search engine, used by Bank of America, Lenovo, and Reddit (this one makes me sad) ). Even so, I believe that Elastic has Solr beat on features, quality, and satisfaction. Solr is a distant 3rd place in the May 2020 DB-Engines ranking for search engines, while Elasticsearch is first (with increasing popularity). Apart from Splunk (which was discussed earlier), other search-capable platforms are very limited in search and analysis capabilities. Elasticsearch completely dominates search as its core competency, and has intrinsic advantages over more rigid competitors like Splunk.

https://preview.redd.it/v7sr37aoo2151.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7bc97e8bd0a6c088c3674b59607b1b5d33dbd8a

*3. Should I be concerned that they are open source?*

While being open source has some cool things going for it--namely, adoption and flexibility--it also has one downside: competition. People can monetize your technology without giving anything back. For example, Amazon has been doing this through some [strip mining.](https://www.datanami.com/2019/03/12/search-war-unfolding-for-control-of-elasticsearch/) While this may appear concerning on the surface, Amazon's Elasticsearch product has structural disadvantages to Elastic's own suite and has not seen anything close to widespread adoption. Moral of the story: it's a nonissue, but you can't  stop Amazon from being a douchebag (except through lawsuits).

*4. Is IV and the risk-reward a concern?*

While Frosty stated that IV was relatively low compared to historical pre-earnings levels, this is borderline not the case anymore (similar to pre 2/26 earnings but higher than pre-earnings levels further in the past). The latest IV-percentile is 82.8 (which means that in 82.8% of trading days in the last 52 weeks, IV was lower than what it is now). But even though IV is relatively high, it isn’t outrageously so--and I think it continues higher. While it might not have quite the same risk-reward as, say, BJs did (post-earnings, I caught a 13 bagger with the 6/19 35c on a 15% move in the underlying), there is still 10 bagger potential here, depending on how far out of the money you go. And if ESTC decides to obliterate the thesis as well--and significantly passes up the previous all-time-high--then there is huge potential for outsized returns. Of all the opportunities on my radar right now, I would say almost bar none.

[Historical IV](https://preview.redd.it/gfo1bgxmv3151.png?width=2104&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c22b183bd3d32199e91a74cc1b7306dd34306d9)

*5. Is it too late to get in after Friday’s 9.18% rise?*

Honestly? Not at all. I believe a new all time high (so above 104.1) is the target, and if the underlying gets there before earnings the 6/19 105c (based on current prices) would become pretty close to a 5 bagger (more with IV). I'd still be a buyer if the stock moves up significantly Tuesday morning. While I have a couple grand in calls right now, I plan to average up and go in big on Tuesday morning. And, while $104.1 is the target, remember that it's just the target; it is entirely possible that ESTC continues climbing past that ATH level.

**The Optimal Way to Play It (Risk Management)**

Risk management is heavily dependent on the individual, so I’m not necessarily telling you what to do here. But from my experience, the hardest thing about a play is not finding companies or even researching (or writing this)--the hardest part is the exit strategy.

But I’ll briefly go over entries and exits, assuming you truly believe the thesis (like I do). If ESTC runs up to anywhere close to $104.1 before earnings, as predicted, the most profitable play percentage-wise pre-earnings will be far OTM June (95-110) or way OTM July calls (July goes up to 140, June to 110). However, this can be dangerous if the stock doesn’t run up pre-earnings. Now, whether you hold through earnings is completely up to you, but it does depend on a few things. First, keep in mind that your risk generally increases as the price of the underlying increases (but with momentum situations, this is not always a bad thing). If we run up to $100 before earnings, holding through earnings will be significantly riskier than holding if the underlying is at $90 right before earnings. Second, keep in mind that (especially with a run-up) holding through earnings is inherently dangerous. Companies can easily crush earnings and still fall, or vice versa. This is relatively less likely with a lesser-known stock like Elastic, but still be open to the possibility. If you do decide to hold through earnings, I’d adjust your strike so that you are (mostly) near the money (with maybe a couple yolos).

If the stock runs up to earnings, I recommend selling at least enough to cover your cost before earnings. The rest is up to you.

Or, there’s always the hold till 0 approach🤷‍♂

**TL;DR**

**$ESTC**

**Spreads are we really discussing this?**

**6/19 75c your name is Frosty**

**6/19 80c must have bought in early**

**6/19 85c boring**

**6/19 90c sensible**

**6/19 95c 4 bagger**

**6/19 100c more like it**

**6/19 110c almost the best you can do**

**7/17 140c the warren buffett, now this is where champions are made**

**I already have most of em, at some point tomorrow I’ll have all of em. A lot of all of em, too. And while Elastic doesn’t believe in investor presentations, this DD was fun writing (and digging). Happy hunting, my fellow autists.**

I have a couple grand in right now, but I’ll be loading up the truck Tuesday morning.

gsk5vt,50,28,wallstreetbets,Verizon DD,0.82,1590747847.0,1590719047.0,"Post been removed every time posted. Remove as you please not posting again this is my final dd post on this company... use as you please.

&#x200B;

Previous  posts what I have been talking about is that I look for oversold stocks with major catalysts coming up near term. Verizon had exactly that Friday. 

&#x200B;

[1 month VZ](https://preview.redd.it/ag21nod5yl151.png?width=789&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9e236a3bcb1426dbab4627720309205caa497f4)

As you can see Verizon has had a bearish trend after running up a bit after march. Being oversold for no reason when multiple catalysts are coming up.

&#x200B;

**Comparing with TMUS and T**

T has been downgraded to hell recently and has no near term catalysts.

Tmus has not been upgrades at all and has some catalysts but the stock is not oversold so more risk to pullbacks.

Verizon has recently reputable analyst upgrades 

&#x200B;

[Upgrades recently](https://preview.redd.it/bxisjvymyl151.png?width=1433&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8f010741e7df52d7f4ff3d0580e10302993fdc0)

Also another bullish sentiment is that hedge funds are increasing positions more than ever before in Verizon. 

 [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-never-bullish-verizon-175738734.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-never-bullish-verizon-175738734.html) 

Always bullish to have smart and big money on your side autists. 

&#x200B;

**Expansion of 5 compared to competitors.**

Already ruling out T as a competitor as we rule out their pretty shit. Real 2 are TMUS and VZ. Both can flourish as well keep that in mind. 

Lots of articles on VZ main focus keeping 5G expansion as number one priority which should be. 

 [https://www.barrons.com/articles/t-mobile-continues-to-outpace-at-t-verizon-now-the-focus-turns-to-sprint-and-5g-51588802443?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/t-mobile-continues-to-outpace-at-t-verizon-now-the-focus-turns-to-sprint-and-5g-51588802443?siteid=yhoof2) 

real kicker now :) Tmus isn't as focused on 5G as Verizon hence why this opportunity is so bullish. 

&#x200B;

Lots of Cash per share

More cash per share than TMUS which allows for more heavy expansion. Also better profit margins allowing for more money to be made blah blah

&#x200B;

**TECHNICAL TIME** 

&#x200B;

[Techys ](https://preview.redd.it/jnalfscvzl151.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=4691b1f300e990b8118e88d7c758d7370c3af4f6)

1st thing to note is we see a VWAP and MACD crossover coming up. Not something to base a trade on but something to solidify your thesis and position. If I did DD yesterday would have went heavy today. You can see first support got CROSSED today. Meaning smart money and people know this is oversold. Wake up people! Oversold stock with major catalysts approaching with a strong balance sheet.

Talking about finances... another bullish sentiment. Debt securities to be redeemed June 15th

 [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-redeem-debt-securities-june-062725915.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-redeem-debt-securities-june-062725915.html) 

For you autists means of a way to pay off debt or interest on debt. 

 [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/future-5g-now-samsung-galaxy-163010245.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/future-5g-now-samsung-galaxy-163010245.html)  \-exclusive to VERIZON

&#x200B;

**DOWNFALLS**

I don't see any downfalls unless market crashes. Does not look like it as unemployment is slowly decreasing. Also something for you autists to know. People LIQUIDATED their portfolio during March. People did not lose their portfolio value, they are loaded in cash. People will keep on entering out of FOMO and new variables. I do not see market crashing like that again... especially not till July 30th which gets into second leg of trade

**Back to good and upsies**

Earnings July 30th which means if trade fucks up because not everybody is right all the time nor an oracle... IV boost will be able to help you get out of the trade. Highly unlikely but always nice to buy time. If u enter buy AT LEAST TILL SEPTEMBER

I only have January calls 57.5 and 60 as I sold everything else yesterday thinking VZ was moving on Spy, but today that changed as VZ kept keeping green even though market sell off at 3-4. 

Will be looking to add tmr at a decent entry price. Price entry is KEY. Will make a follow up post/post when I'm entering and what I'm buying because some of you autists need hand holding. 

&#x200B;

**Am I retarded?**

A little but your call

MY REPUTATION: Have had some good and bad trades like all which I posted on WSB.

Good: EROS (600% on merger) Abeo(100 percent on oversold due to corona) Selling TWLO puts( 100 percent because TWLO gapped 40 percent on earnings). TWTR earnings runup( sold before earnings at 100 percent gain). 

BAD: Selling Roku puts ( got out with 20 percent loss even though earnings were bad. If you play earnings always write the options. ZOM( but posted as a joke and sold my position right after taking the screen shot)- it was obv a joke but I will count it as an L. CPB CALLS( my thesis was wrong and I admit it was a bad trade. Hit my stop loss at 50 percent loss but know people who did not sell and now options are worthless... I'm sorry for that. I did not do enough DD and went in knowing low volume on options. Everyone makes mistakes in trading. Never a perfect game. 

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Oversold stock with major catalysts. Both technicals and fundamentals look good to push share price of stock.** 

**57.5 and 60 jan calls. Will add tmr and post when I enter and which specific calls I'm buying for those that need to be spoon-fed.**",2020-05-28
gt1fha,59,253,stocks,I'm finalizing my portfolio for this year.,0.97,1590815550.0,1590786750.0,"It's been a while since I made a big post. Lots of people are still messaging me about the energy sector post, especially for the ENPH tip, so I'm here to show my portfolio. I don't own all companies yet, this is partially hypothetical. I'm holding on to a reasonable cash position for a possible new downturn, but I have starting positions in most companies and will DCA.

I will try to keep it summarized, as I have done quite a lot of analysis on each of them. I'll draw the main picture and give the most important arguments for my choices, but I'm not expanding too much. If you're interested, you can DM me to talk about them more.

Let me start by saying I'm a growth investor. I always look for a combination of growth with a great track record, if possible at a reasonable price. There are exceptions as you will see below, but the main balance stays the same. I'm not a defensive investor, but no aggressive one either. My timeline is 2-5 years at least (due to a possible start of a small business), but I would gladly hold on to these companies 10+ years.

TLDR; For you guys not interested in my portfolio, I've added a short list of interesting smaller cap companies at the end, most of them trading at decent values.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES - $AMD**

This one is becoming a blue chip, but has more than enough growth potential to live up to those high valuations. Preferred by gamers and beating their biggest competitor in the CPU market hard. While AMD and INTC were close competitors at the beginning of the 21st century, INTC took the lead by a lot. Since 2017, they introduced 7nm CPU's and GPU's and they are closing the gap fast. Not only are their chips more performant, they are also cheaper. Market cap $60B vs $261b.

Those next generation chips lead them to new partnerships, often beating INTC. Microsoft, a long time Intel customer, began using AMD chips in their Surface laptops. Lenovo using AMD for their new servers. Nvidia started using the chips in their AI products. AMD is also used by Apple's high-end laptops, while Intel (used in the budget range) will probably get replaced by Apple chips made in-house. Apart from laptops, AMD has government contracts to deliver supercomputers in 2021/2023 and they are used in both PS and XBOX consoles, to give a few examples.

For the CPU market, AMD is destined to take over, but they're also taking on NVDA for their GPU's. They have been catching up for years and in 2019 they finally made a better performing GPU in the $350-400 price range. There is a possibility to gain GPU market cap since NVDA has been pushing their prices due to the lack of competition. Therefore, with AMD stepping up their game, they need to give up market share or lower their margins.

**Financial**

Assets over liabilities are x1.88. Cash to debt ratio well above industry average, debt to EBITDA well below IA. ROE 17.12% and ROIC 28.06%. Earnings were growing fast before Covid (125% in Q3, 78% in Q4). Yes they're overvalued, but with their future outlook, I would always buy below $49.

**Doubts**

Now that they are done catching up, the question is, will they outperform in the future. To gain more market share of Nvidia, they need to be better, not equally good. AMD also needs to control the heating better, as it is one of their long term problems.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**MASTERCARD - $MA**

Fintech companies like SQ and PYPL are a great investment. However, a lot of big companies will (and already did) implement online financial services. MA is able to easily work with multiple of those companies and they're using their global presence pretty well, that's why they're my pick for the fintech industry.

They launched Mastercard Accelerate last year, implementing those online paying platforms and letting start-ups take advantage of their global presence to grow and transform very fast. Last year they acquired Ethoca (managing e-commerce fraud) and Vyze (platform to connect merchants with multiple renders, giving them the opportunity to get those financial needs for start-ups). MA is basically helping start-ups to grow faster, which will result in more financial transactions in the future.

Last but not least, they like to focus on expanding to countries where there isn't much competition yet. They are expanding their exposure to Middle East and Africa, working with local networks and e-commerce platforms. They are in a strong position to capitalize those regions in the future and take on market leader Visa even more.

They get compared a lot to Visa, so I'll expand on that subject a bit as well. While V is focussing on performance and speed, MA plays the cyber security card. They are already working on ways to implement cryptocurrency and Mastercard tend to have more growth potential vs stability from market leader Visa. While V is in the lead, MA is more widely used by fintech companies, which shows potential take-over in the future. Next to their credit services, they also own debit service Maestro, which is widely used in Europe.

**Financial**

Returns as high as 150% (ROE) and 60% (ROIC). Very large margins and perfectly stable balance sheet. High EPS growth YoY, 53% and 42% in the last two years. Quick ratio 1.87. V has more assets and even bigger margins, however MA wins in returns and cash. In terms of more growth, I like to focus on those last numbers more.

**Doubts**

It's a blue chip at a $300B market cap. Their growth potential might be limited, although I see them as one of the better picks between blue chips.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**ENPHASE ENERGY - $ENPH**

I already talked about solar energy in another post, so I'm gonna skip the explanation. As some of you know my choices were ENPH and SEDG, so I'll explain a bit about why I choose ENPH here. Mainly it's because of their financials, so I'll dive that straight away.

Quick ratio - 2.35 vs 1.74

ROE - 142.94% vs 21.51%

ROIC - 85.51% vs 25.81%

Net margin - 25.81% vs 10.28%

However I think SEDG balance sheet is a lot better and safer, ENPH is working on their future more efficient. They are paving the way smoothly with bigger margins and return on investments. Although SEDG might be the better pick right now, ENPH will be the better one in a short while. ENPH is also a bit less overvalued and their PEG ratio is lower, which makes them the better pick to get in right now.

Diving into the products as well, ENPH just has the better and more efficient product. Their micro inverters are more durable (20 vs 12 years) and give the chance to increase or decrease the amount of solar panels easily, depending on your personal situation.

**GALAPAGOS - $GLPG**

I'm not a big fan of biotech companies, but these guys have my attention. Not because they're working on Covid vaccines, but because of two reasons. First one is them getting back-up from Gilead Sciences. That's the push they needed to start operating worldwide, increasing their potential market cap. Now that they have the cash from GILD, they can keep on buying interesting divisions and increase their growth. While having almost no long term debt, they are set pretty well with about $4 billion extra in cash.

Second, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases, with Filgotinib as their biggest one. They had a setback on those results, but the company is very confident, giving an opportunity to get them at a decent price. I wouldn't be surprised if they partner up with another big pharmaceutical company in the metabolic disease section.

**Financial**

High PE (84 vs 44 average), but PEG ratio is 1.2. Quick ratio 9.28. ROIC 75.91% and ROE 7%. Became profitable this year with 16.25% net margin. 38.7% YoY EPS growth.

**Doubts**

Like all biotech players, there's a lot depending on medicines getting through phase trials and being commercialized. If Filgotinib will fail, their stock will obviously fall. However since they are backed by a big US giant, they can commercialize the product faster and on a bigger global scale if trials succeed. That's what gives them the advantage in comparison to other biotech companies for me.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**WALT DISNEY - $DIS**

This one has got me doubting a lot. I've taken them off and put them back on my list multiple times, but eventually I decided to keep them at least 2 years to see how they will evolve into streaming.

Biggest advantage they have on their competitors is they basically have a monopoly on kids entertainment. Kids are growing up with electronic devices and content, so they're creating customers at a very young age. That's how Coca Cola used to work. They targeted 14-16 year olds, dumping loads of money into advertising which resulted in life long customers, as people didn't change cola brands often.

Disney+ is a big hit and they won't get so much competition from other streaming services as Netflix and Roku will. They have one of the strongest defined brands out there and they know perfectly how to build and maintain their company. It's also still unclear how sports with public will evolve, but it's certain streaming will become even bigger after Covid. Therefore their money-losing ESPN acquisition could even turn into a moneymaker.

**Financial**

I can't really say great things about their financials. ROE is 12.67%, above 10% is decent. Assets over liabilities are x1.85 and debt to equity is 0.61. You could apply the saying ""too big to fail' here, but that's about it. The bad financials are mainly caused by their big investment to streaming of course and they're working on it hard. They doubled their cash position, increasing their quick ratio from 0.75 to 0.89.

**Doubts**

I would say financials are their weak point here. They still have to go through some bad weather this and next year I would say. Them doubling their cash position in Q1 was soothing, as I see it being the biggest issue for the future. It might be better to wait it out and keep an eye on them for next year, but I wanted to take a position already. Not higher than 8% of my portfolio though.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**MICROSOFT - $MSFT**

They don't really an introduction I guess. 2nd biggest player for cloud services with Azure. Naming Satya Nadella as CEO and making the transition from hardware to software in 2014 were the best decisions they could've made. Acquired the government contract with Pentagon, however there's still uncertainty about it. In short, Amazon is claiming they were about to win the contract, but Trump criticizing the company would've lead to calling off the deal. For me, that's probably the main reason why MSFT didn't fly as high as their fellow cloud competitors yet.

**Financial**

Assets over liabilities x1.67. ROE and ROIC respectively at 43.82% and 28.88%. Quick ratio of 2.88, 0.65 debt to equity and 1.86 cash to debt. Decent financials, great returns. Talking about blue chips, I would say MSFT is still fairly valued with a PEG ratio just below industry average. Also paying a small dividend.

**Doubts**

The Pentagon contract allegations could be pretty negative for the company. They will probably not come back on their decision, cause if they do, MSFT will claim they already made big investments towards them and things will just keep on dragging on. Even without the contract, MSFT should be a 10 year hold while buying on dips.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**INNOVATIVE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES - $IIPR**

Haven't read a lot about them here on Reddit, but they're a very decent investment. Basically, they buy properties from cannabis companies and leases them back to the sellers, giving them the cash they need to grow faster and IIPR keeps the long term advantage of renting out those properties. They need to buy about 6-8 properties a year to keep their growth rate going and they already bought 7 this year. They still have a lot of cash ready to take advantage of the crisis.

Not only are they 20% undervalued right now, they have a lot more growth potential after that and on top of it, they pay close to 5% dividend. I'm not a big fan of betting on the best cannabis company for the future, but IIPR is a great buy to have exposure in that industry. It doesn't happen very often I come across a company that combines growth potential with a high dividend, but IIPR does.

**Financial**

Quick ratio 6.75, cash to debt 2.8 (while REITs have an 0.07 average). Net margins 13% above average. Assets over liabilities x4.88. Annual EPS growing by more than 150% and about 41% in the last quarter before Covid. They just missed Q1 estimates, but it was only an 8% drop from Q4, performing way better than other REITs.

**Doubts**

IIPR has held a lot of new investment rounds, diluting shares. Of course extra capital will result in higher growth and will eventually be positive in the long run. There has been a drop in these last few days due to the announcement of selling 1 million more shares soon. I would look at it as an opportunity to get an even better price on them.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**TELADOC HEALTH - $TDOC**

It's the only company I don't own yet. I can't force myself to invest more than $140 per share for them, although I really like their business model. A lot of people are skipping doctors visits these days, going straight away to get medicines and counting on the advice of pharmacists. A lot of times, there's more examination needed.

Not only do I see them succeeding in their field, I see them as an essential part of the automation of the pharmacy industry. It's a useful tool in emergencies, giving advice and deciding how serious the condition is, if (fast) medical care is needed. Teladoc will also play a role in insurance and giving the employers a checking tool. 98.9% of their shares are owned by institutions.

**Financial**

In terms of profitability and returns, not great of course. They are estimated to get profitable in 2023. Great balance sheet, assets over liabilities x2.66. Quick ratio 6.14, cash to debt 1.06, debt to equity 0.48.

**Doubts**

It's hard to see if a company is well managed before they are profitable. Their moat isn't very narrow, however I feel being one of the first ones gives you a big advantage in this field.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**DRAFTKINGS - $DKNG**

Gonna keep this one pretty short, there has been enough posts about Donkey Kong. For me, the most important factor for choosing them in this industry is their fantasy sports section. They are widely popular and that division will only get more interesting while online gambling, and especially in-game betting, gets more and more legalized in the US.

Although they realized major revenue growth in 2019, they almost doubled their earnings loss. Main reason of course having to develop their platform and system. Good thing is, their technology is highly scalable, meaning they margin will grow massively while expanding in to more states and countries. Not many ratios available yet, so that's about the only financial information I own atm.

The only negative I see is their pretty wide moat, so this one should be monitored more closely in the future. But for now, they have the momentum and are one of the most popular choices, great investment.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

**RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES - $RTX**

As many of you know, two great companies (UTC and RTN) merged together in April. While United focussed on aircraft engines (Pratt & Whitney), Raytheon manufactured weapons, military and commercial electronics. They always delivered advanced technologies and them gaining multiple government contracts in the last decade is confirmation of their performant products.

Raytheon will continue to grow their leadership in different segments. Because of their diversity, they seem perfectly in place to grow even more into an aerospace & defense giant. Engines, aerostructures, avionics, sensors, cybersecurity and other software solutions are just a few examples of their working fields.

**Financial**

With a PE ratio of 13.58 and PB ratio of 1.41, this is probably the most undervalued stock in my portfolio. Assets over liabilities x1.43. The rest of their financials isn't that great. UTC was carrying a lot of debt, but because of the merger, it will be better balanced as RTN was only carrying $2 billion net debt. If they can decrease their debt and optimize their merger, they are set to be the new number one in defense.

**Doubts**

It's still unclear how the merger will work out financially and logistically. In theory, they should be very well armed (pun intended) to take on LMT as market leader. Their exposure to commercial aircrafts is also a big threat, but it's less of an issue because they can make up with their other practices.

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

As you can see, I've tried to get the best blue chips with still some growth potential and stable growth companies together. Since a lot of companies already got mentioned on this forum, I'll include a bonus round of interesting companies I came across during my search for the best companies. I didn't include them in my portfolio mainly because I feel the chance of them succeeding and living up to their future potential is more risky than others. For you looking for higher risk, higher reward, check out these companies below.

* **$INMD.** They offer minimally-invasive aesthetic medical products for various procedures, such as liposuction with simultaneous skin tightening, body and face contouring. They are actually the only company in my watchlist that scored maximum on my financial checklist. I love to watch their financials. While we're in an overvalued market, INMD has only 18.73 PE and 0.6 PEG. They certainly got hit by Covid, but I would be very surprised if they don't multiply their market share over the next years.
* **$SMCI.** Based mainly on servers and storage solutions. They are the supplier for cloud computing and AI based companies. They were ranked 18th fastest growing company by Fortune Magazine in 2016, but they still have a long way possible to grow. I see them stagnating a bit for a few years, but they definitely have potential in the long run. Financially very stable, big on cash to make some acquisitions and trading at only 14.84 PE.
* **$CDLX.** Great business model. They basically turn financial transaction data into valuable information for advertising. They show returns as high as 30:1 for advertising spent. Not only is the online payment industry growing fast, but after Covid companies will need to work their advertising budgets even more efficiently. CDLX has momentum and will increase that market cap massively. That future outlook has a price unfortunately and I feel they're too expensive right now.
* **$OLED.** They hold patents on ultra high definition OLED screen technology. There's still a large transition going on from LED to OLED screens. They are estimated to increase their manufacturing with 50% by the end of 2021. Unfortunately most of that growth is already priced in right now. It doesn't take away the longer term potential, but it doesn't make it that sexy of a buy right now.
* **$OMCL.** Omnicell provides pharmacy automation solutions and other tools for healthcare systems. Big on cash, low on debt. They have an interesting business and the automation of healthcare will continue to grow, however they are also trading a bit above value.
* **$PCOM.** A technology company based on e-commerce and services through loyalty programs. Most of their partners are airlines, which explains their difficulties of getting back up since the drop. At the moment it's unsure how this will work out. There will barely be room for bargains or rewards, however while the industry has to build up again, there's an opportunity to take away long time customers from competitors. Although they have enough cash to weather this crisis, they are depending on the industry. At PE below 10 and having a decent cash position, it's worth a gamble.
* **$APPS.** Digital Turbine offers a mobile platform mainly for new apps. They have a very high future revenue forecast of 202.2% over the next 3 years. Big on cash and no debt as well. They already acquired Mobile Posse in March, diversifying their platform. Analysts are putting an average price target of $9.88 on them, giving it a 61% potential return.
* **$NVMI.** They develop and produce process control systems used in the manufacturing of semiconductors, mainly focussing on industrializing X-ray and optical technologies like holographic images. Cash to debt 6.1, debt to equity 0.1, quick ratio 5.75, ROE 12.83% and ROIC 20.26%. Their financials are great. The only thing you could say is they are slightly overvalued, but still a very nice buy in comparison to the overvalued tech industry.
* **$INS.** Active in the fintech sector, they provide tech solutions and processing services. Very similar financials to NVMI. Big on cash, almost no long term debt, great returns (ROE 29.7% / ROIC 85.95%)  and steady growing EPS. They are also slightly overvalued, but should easily get back to $45 range after the crisis is over.

So, that's about all I have to share. This will also be my last big post a while. Analyzing stocks has been my main occupation for the last three months, but it's time to work on opening up the hotel and bar again. I hope some of you get something out of this. I'm not a professional so always check again for yourself. I'm gonna hold on to these companies for a while now. Will add some extra capital at the beginning of 2021, so you could expect another big post about my newest findings then. For now, I'm gonna take a break from following the market day in day out and enjoy the weather a bit more.

I’ve had decent success since March buying weekly options on overbought/oversold names. Call it mean reversion I guess. Or a mild form of FDing (usually only 5-10% from the money so not a proper YOLO). I call it gambling and when it hits I can confirm it is better than doing a really good sex.

This market is simultaneously on fucking molly cut with crack and meth (QE) and quaaludes laced with LSD and xannys (helicopter money, no Kobe). For all you substance-induced mental state altering retards out there, you know what I mean. Markets be hella extra, just poppin off one minute, then trippy af the next, culminating in a state of delusion followed by unresponsiveness then total loss of fine motor skill functionality. 

Until...

Fauci’s bitchass is coerced by Trump to say something positive or vaccine quasi-news or J-Pow revealing his 10 inch cock on 60 min or footage of Chad/Becky Memorial Day hiatus at the Ozarks or Black Lives Matter season 2 in MN or Cold War with China cunts - or whatever the fuck the next headline is - causes a little jolt of energy and momentum building up leading to a full send which gets way overdone, then violently corrects/reverses with the quickness. Confused? Look at ZM chart as of late...

Fundamentals and valuation: 

* They don't make money (no earnings, no PE) 
* Negative profit margin, negative operation margin
* Negative return on assets, negative return on equity
* Earnings per share growth is way below industry average 
* Revenue growth is above industry averages but should slow down as the economy re-opens. 
* Their interest coverage ratio is at -63.92x which means they don't earn enough from day-to-day operations to service their debt (although you can argue they do have decent cash flow to satisfy current obligations)

Recent news:

* Recent news of TCL's android-powered smart television coming to Best-Buy had shares continuing to fall
* HBO Max streaming service was NOT distributed on ROKU
* Target price recently downgraded from $155 to $105

Technicals:

* Price below 200 and 50 MA
* MAC D line still below signal line and descending past the zero line on the histogram on the daily chart - bearish signal
* Chaikin oscillator shows downtrend below the zero line - bearish signal
* RSI sitting at 40 but continuing to trend down on the daily chart
* On the volume profile, the price is starting to breach the low volume area of the 100-102 range
* If it breaks the next next pivot point at 98, the stock could perhaps retest the March lows as there's not much support from the volume profile standpoint

Dear Friends and Shareholders: In these unprecedented times where we are all looking for healing and positivity, there is nothing more important than a smile, and that smile is the core of our product at Genius

Benzinga · 6/5/2020, 9:20:51 AM

Dear Friends and Shareholders:
In these unprecedented times where we are all looking for healing and positivity, there is nothing more important than a smile, and that smile is the core of our product at Genius Brands.  We make animated cartoons for children, and families. We tell stories, which make children feel good, make them laugh, and bring them joy.  We seek to enrich with positive lessons, tolerance, and inclusion, and that has never been more important than today.
To that end, I am proud to share that this morning we announced the engagement of the most successful programming executive in the history of children’s television, Margaret Loesch, as Executive Chairman of Kartoon Channel!
Loesch was the founding president and CEO of Fox Kids Networks Worldwide, growing the channels across all metrics, where it was eventually sold to the Walt Disney Company for $5.5 billion.
Joining Margaret will be the former President of Walt Disney Television, David Neuman, who will become Kartoon Channel!, Chief Content Officer.
David, among other things, oversaw the Wonderful World of Disney and the then #1 sitcom on television, Home Improvement, and earned over 100 Emmys on his watch, while there and previously as Head of Comedy Development at NBC.
It would be impossible for me to adequately sing their praises and the impact these two extraordinarily talented and accomplished people can bring to bear upon Kartoon Channel!, our new kids program service.
Margaret has been a value creator of epic proportions throughout her career, and she brings a gift for picking and developing hit programs and creating hit schedules.  She ran NBC Saturday morning, before leaving for Hanna-Barbera Productions, where she was head of development and production where she oversaw the massive hit, Smurfs, among their other many productions. From there, she went to become President of Marvel Entertainment, where she produced hit after hit, and subsequent to that, went to FOX as founder and CEO of FOX Kids, after which she became President of Jim Henson Television. The brands she has produced and broadcast are legendary. Power Rangers, Batman, Spider-Man, Steven Spielberg’s Animaniacs, Transformers, My Little Pony, X-Men, Muppet Babies, and Fraggle Rock are among the many.
The value of each company and network, she was at was enriched dramatically by her presence.  She is on the Board of Governors of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and is a rare ‘triple threat’, who knows the Broadcast Business, the Production Business, and the Advertising Business.
As I said this in announcing them, this is like having Michael Jordan and LeBron James on the same team.  Alongside Margaret and David is our ultra-talented General Manager, Caroline Tyre, who, ‘by the way’, ran the top children’s broadcast service in Canada, Teletoon, and helped launch Cartoon Network, Boomerang, and Adult Swim in Canada.
As we run up to the launch of Kartoon Channel! on June 15, we are all excited about the unprecedented carriage and launch footprint, which covers more than 100 million U.S. TV households and 200 million mobile devices, across cable, satellite, digital, and OTT platforms, including Comcast, COX, Dish, Apple TV, Amazon Prime, Amazon Fire, Roku, and Tubi, among them.
We previously described Kartoon Channel!  like “a Netflix for kids, but its free.”  Our model is what is called in the industry, AVOD (Advertiser Video On Demand). There is an important significance to this, which in today’s children’s broadcast world, brings powerful ‘wind to our sails’.

Netflix and Disney +, viewership is dramatically up, because people are staying at home more.  For a combination of COVID-19 and social reasons, this is even more so for children’s TV (e.g. most schools closed, many summer camps have been canceled).
 

Children’s Advertiser Demand is UP, while Available Inventory is Scarce.  Inventory is scarce, because more and more kids have migrated from linear channels to On Demand channels and much of that On Demand viewing is on Netflix and on Disney+ where there is no advertising.  The result is that advertisers need to scramble to find commercial inventory and ‘eyeballs’ through which to promote their products, and brands.

Kartoon Channel! will launch with a number of ‘programming events’, which we believe will be extremely compelling for kids, and which we will announce for you the week before launch.
Having said the above, we want our shareholders to measure expectations.  We will start providing projections beginning Q4, at which point we will have visibility on viewing patterns and advertising.  (In the kid’s media business, the ‘hard 8’, those weeks leading up to Christmas is where 50% of the year’s advertising revenue is typically generated.)
While turning the channel on is not a ‘light switch,’ in Margaret and David, we have two of the smartest most proven programmers in the business, and we are going to succeed and take share from a multi-billion-dollar kid’s advertising pie.
We are committed to ensure that the team of Margaret, David, and General Manager, Caroline Tyre, have the resources they need to acquire the most competitive children’s product, and the marketing to drive the channel forward.
Margaret, David, and Caroline will have multiple tools in their toolbox to succeed, not least of which will be the pristine balance sheet of Genius Brands, modest debt, and the substantial cash in its war chest to drive the channel forward. In addition, they will have Genius Brands own carefully curated properties from top creators and producers including:
Stan Lee’s Cosmic Crusaders
Warren Buffett’s Secret Millionaires Club
Martha & Friends
Because we carefully curate our owned entertainment that we produce for the channel to be not only positive and enriching for children, but equally, to lend itself to licensed consumer products, Kartoon Channel! will complete a ‘Virtuous Circle""* for Genius Brands and drive a second income stream.
The shows we produce go on the channel, and they get aggressively promoted to create viewership and launch positive consumer products, from which we earn to invest in more content.
We are committed to not just entertain, but also to enrich, and as a parent of a 12-year-old myself, I can assure you that is, and will always be, front and center, as we work to create growing value and pride for our shareholders.
Welcome to Margaret Loesch and David Neuman!
Our business is smiles.
Sincerely,
Andy Heyward
Chairman & CEO
Genius Brands International, Inc.

gz1375,496,623,wallstreetbets,Kroger (KR) is the next pandemic play for max gains,0.97,1591657792.0,1591628992.0,"Kroger is the second largest grocer in the store behind Walmart. [Their earnings are on the 18th.](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/kr)

&nbsp;

## Let's make some comparisons 

&nbsp;

SpartanNash (SPTN) is an American food distributor and grocery store. They [already reported earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sptn/earnings) and beat estimates by $0.20/share. It had a 23% run-up before earnings ($16s -> $20s).

&nbsp;

Let's also consider United Natural Foods (UNFI) which reports on the 10th and already prereported blockbuster earnings and pulled 2020 guidance because they've already met it and plan to issue an update when earnings comes out. In the last couple of weeks, they've also experienced a run-up ($17s -> $20s) despite most of the good news being priced in. 

&nbsp;

## Why Kroger? 

&nbsp;

It's similar to the above two companies with earnings not until next week. For those who follow my posts, I posted [DD on UNFI last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gun1mo/my_next_june_earning_play_during_this_pandemic/). TBH I waited too long to get into UNFI watching it rise, waiting for a dip to buy in, and missing out on a lot of gains. So I'm posting this early and buying in as early as possible to get ahead of the game on this one. As mentioned, there was a price run up on both UNFI and SPTN this last month, so I'm buying now and early to capture this. 

&nbsp;

Their EPS estimate has a $0.88 consensus which I believe they're likely to beat. When UNFI revises their guidance on June 10th, I think the entire supermarket segment will rise on sentiment from the UNFI guidance which will be a strong upward price catalyst for Kroger the week before their earnings. It will confirm that grocers should have continued strong results through 2020. 

&nbsp;

Recovery is slow and restaurants are just starting to reopen. Unemployment is still in the double digits and people have gotten used to eating at home and are also weary of spending extra cash on eating out.

&nbsp;

Should be continued strong sales throughout the summer and revised upward guidance from Kroger when earnings come out. They are up 37% over the last year but have traded relatively flat through the pandemic (last 3 months). They were deemed essential and made to work a lot of hours to get food back out to the stores. 

&nbsp;

## What I'm doing

&nbsp;

So basically the trade on this is trading the news for the rest of the sector. The stock is about $4/share off their 52 week high, so the $35c 6/19 is the play due to it's ample open interest and tight bid/ask spread. 

&nbsp;

**tldr $35c 6/19**

&nbsp;

Edit: It's important to note that a portion of KR's rise today [was attributed to it's partnership with Roku](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/roku-stock-gains-after-company-announces-new-ad-targeting-program-2020-06-08). This should definitely add to the stock's upward momentum this coming week.

Edit2: I sold today. The market's crashing and will probably take KR with it. Earning plays aren't the best idea right now.",2020-06-08

Friday rolls around, and Amazon is -$100.    I write that $30K off as a goner.

We collapsed, and I went on a shopping spree, among the options contracts I loaded up on was ROKU.

Today I broke even, and I foolishly, stupidly thought. Well this is basically running parallel to SPY.
 How about I sell! Tomorrow Jpow has to face another round of hearings and I will but back in! Bulletproof!

After I sold, ROKU took off in such spectacular fashion that I haven't quite been able to forgive myself for. If I had just held it would have single handedly not only broke me even after the week of losses but put me in the green.

hamkwe,56,355,wallstreetbets,The key difference between retard and autist,0.95,1592407879.0,1592379079.0,"I see way too many people going full retard and needlessly losing money on every trade they make, let me drop some common sense to help you out regadless your animal gang affiliation.

*TL;DR: retard is mindlessly chasing fomo trading himself into 98% loss, autists develops thesis so batshit crazy, it could actually work and then either buys a yacht or lose all his money going for it*

Options trading, especially short term and high frequency like daily and weekly is high risk high reward game. That means by definition you are going to be wrong most of the time and when you are sometimes right, it will make up for your losses and some.

Since you know you are going to be wrong most of the time, you can't afford to make a trade which will lose you all or most of your money, so you can get going until you score a profit. You need strict loss limit strategy for every trade. There are plenty of information out there how to do that, learn about it.

Now for the retard vs autist key difference

Autist does own DD, creates a thesis by using his high levels of autism analyzing and piecing together solid data. That thesis is so insane it can actually work so he goes for it big, like a true autist he is. He either becomes millionaire on a single trade or loses everything. Now even when autist is wrong and blew all his money, his incredible amount of work and bravery that went into that trade is worth of admiration and celebration. Either way, he becomes a legend.

Retard on the other hand, keeps following fomo around without any strategy or general idea how anything he is doing works. Scoring one loss after another until he is at 98%+ loss. That's going full retard, because falling for fomo once should be enough to realize how retarded that trade was. Furher retarding himself by crying about how literally every trade he made went exactly the opposite way right when he bought in.

Let me explain how fomo works, so you can stop walking into at least the most obvious traps. For every trade to happen, there has to be someome buying and someone selling. That means, by the time you learn about fomo and are about to buy into it, there are traders ready to take a profit and they need you to sell their bag to you. Once sell off starts happening, which is excatly when fomo is happening, price is about to reverse hard, leaving you holding the bag of time limited options, which are going to expire worthless, because theta decay.

At last, there are now mutliple pump and dump schemes going on like ROKU, because trading volume on some stocks is so low, even a small group of people can swing the price really hard and really fast. These people will bait you into fomo on these stocks, leave you holding their bag and move on. Point being made here, watch trading volume if you see movements to know if this is new legit trend taking off or pump and dump bait.

DISCLAIMER: I am just another dude trying his luck by taking advantage of high volatility and leveraged instruments with calculated risk trades. And of course I did fuck up big when greed got better of me by doubling down on my own fault thesis refusing to cut loss and holding bag until expiration.

And I am sure for most people here this is all obvious common sense and I just wasted your time by being gay in attempt to save at least one retard from himself.

Positions: DIA 260c 6/30 as hedge for SPY 288p, 280p, 277p 8/21 becuase if we have another bull, retards are likely going to pump stocks in DIA harder than any other major index.

The S&P utility index performed especially poorly declining (-3.1%), and the S&P energy index fell (-1.7%).

Yesterdays picks were ERI 41.10 (+.33, +.81%), SE 106.94 +.46, (0.43%), EQR 59.43 (-1.91, 3.11%), and VIPS 21.00 (+.32, +1.55%). I decided to not place any trades today on these picks.

Let’s find gold,0.78,1592824333.0,1592795533.0,"Built my bankroll swing trading and now it’s time to settle down and transfer my investments for the long haul. Love companies like NET, MSFT, DIS, RTX, DKNG, SHOP, TELSA. This would be my goal high risk high reward portfolio. 

I’ve always been anti ETF, seems like they never move and even if their biggest holdings do well they can go down.

Well I cashed out my holdings in my trading app and am transferring to my big boy portfolio. Here are my holdings. 

First off screw spy and voo. Boring

I went sectors I was interested in for example I love DraftKings and NET but who knows if the competition comes out of nowhere and eats them up. So let’s go with BETZ and WCLD

So here’s my ETFs I’ll be buying into and some of their top holdings.

BUYZ- AMZN, SHOP, SE, BABA, Mercado-
Online shopping if the future

WCLD- Fastly, ZM, DDOG, DOCU, Wix-
Everything will be on the cloud 

BETZ- GAN, DKNG, Flutter, PENN-
It’s like investing in alcohol during the prohibition 

XNTK- Telsa, SHOP, AMZN, AMD, Activison, NVDA-
Who doesn’t love those companies futures 

ARKW- TSLA, SQ, PINS, ROKU-
You had me at Telsa and square leading an ETF

ARKQ- TSLA, 2U, Autodesk, Teradyne-
If telsa doesn’t moon one of these next gen stocks will

QCLN- TSLA and bunch of clean energy stocks-
Shut up I like telsa and oil will go dry eventually right?

IETC - Microsoft, Apple , FB, google-
This was my favorite MSFT heavy etf

PPA- RTX, Lockheed, Honeywell, BA-
Defense stock of choice

FDIS- AMZN, HD, Nike, telsa, McDonald’s -
30% Amazon

PEJ- chipotle, DIS, PENN, LUV-
Favorite Disney etf (IYC gets a shoutout here)

SHE- PayPal, V, MA, Gilead, HD-
My banking etf with the most interesting holdings 

GERM- covid ETF-
I always wanted to invest in the cure(it’s in here) 

PW- my REIT, holds greenhouses for solar energy and marijuana. And railroads. None of which will be affected much when people can’t pay mortgage or start working from home.

I went out of the box, some of these ETFs aren’t priced super high and make it easier for me to keep adding to positions. I think the total holdings were very unique that help with the potential.

hg9vz4,20,10,wallstreetbets,Google's 'Sabrina' threatens ROKU's dominance,0.78,1593214783.0,1593185983.0,"ROKU shareholders and prospective shareholders should read about Google's streaming device release ['Sabrina' potentially coming out later this year](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-android-tv-dongle-specs-gaming-mode-stadia-support/). Here's a video demo of the product as well: [Sabrina video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=gLCoaEDBre0&feature=emb_logo). All of this was obtained from a firmware pre-release. It's legit, but not disseminated across the market/officially announced yet.

ROKU's strength comes from dominance in two important areas:

* Their device marketshare [(a plurality at \~39%)](https://www.multichannel.com/news/roku-and-fire-tv-control-70-percent-of-smp-market), secured both by actual Roku devices as well as software licenses to smart TV manufacturers like TCL, Insignia, Sharp, Hisense, Hitachi, LG.
* Their ownership of DataXu, which aside from the The Trade Desk (TTD), has the best Connected TV buying platform. They were the first to marry access to all major suppliers with a cross device graph and performance reporting. Most buying platforms or ‘Demand Side Platforms (DSPs)’ have access to the same inventory, but prior to their acquisition, DataXu did a terrific job of overlaying the right tools and technology to attract buyers. This made them an excellent acquisition target for Roku. Of course this is all a little subjective, but I’m lucky enough to work in this business, so I’m sharing some aggregated insights from ad buyers. Also worth mentioning: [Roku captures 59% of all programmatic ad marketshare.](https://blog.pixalate.com/ott-ctv-programmatic-ad-device-market-share-roku-2019#:~:text=Here%20are%20the%20top%20five,Chromecast%20(4%25))

The reason I’m highlighting all of this, is that ROKU has done what so many have failed to do…combine device marketshare with a focused, well-loved CTV buying platform. Why have FAANG struggled to do this?

* Amazon is a content producer (Prime Video) as well as a device/software manufacturer (Fire TV). They sell advertising (Amazon DSP), but so much of it is focused on shopping and direct response. It’s not a focused platform, and the ad buyers I know have shied away from Amazon DSP as an aggregated CTV buying solution for now.
* Netflix is a content producer and a CTV app. They are also known for not having advertising. To me, they are the least likely to compete with Roku on the device side, and have way too much conflict to launch a full fledged ad business that would enable ad buyers to purchase space on other apps. It doesn’t even make sense. It may not be worth a bullet on this list…but I wanted to address where they sit for those that are ROKU buyers but may not be as familiar with how the industry breaks down.
* Apple has Apple TV, but seems pretty disinterested in creating a minority report-level ad business. In fact, they’ve been the most aggressive about shutting down third party cookies. Ads in the app store are the extent of their ad business today. Maybe one day they’ll do direct sponsorships on Apple Music, but they are technological AND philosophical lightyears away from touching user ID-driven advertising.

….Google launching a plug and play device, however, is very interesting. They’ve had Android TV as a native OS, but Sabrina represents a direct attack on Roku’s independent device business. Google is also known for breaking down its ad platform into manageable parts for ad buyers. They have one platform specific to search called Search Ads 360.. and one for display & video called DV360. They also have the most widely trusted data analytics platform for marketers: Google Analytics.

If Sabrina becomes wildly popular, Roku could face a serious threat. If the rumors about Google wanting to acquire Roku are true, that would be good news for us…and may represent Google’s desire to do an instant takeover of the CTV device space. This is why I'm waiting to open any new positions for now.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Still bullish on ROKU in the longterm as they have an unbelievable head start, but Google’s Sabrina device represents a potential threat, and more importantly a ***perceived*** threat to Roku’s dominant device + ad business marketshare. Owners of the stock should track news of this release.

Positions:Own 200 ROKU shares @ $110.Waiting for additional acquisition news, but will likely buy ROKU 1/15 $110P within the next 60-90 days

**EDIT**: To be clear, I'm not planning selling my position in ROKU because I agree with those commenting that they have a massive head start and that Google has tons of catching up to do. However, Sabrina represents a marked change from the way previous Chromecasts have been marketed. This is a CTV device with an interface + apps. It's a direct challenger to existing devices. This can be seen as an opportunity to buy ROKU Jan puts to capitalize on a cursory understanding of the Sabrina launch...or even a ROKU buying opportunity. Sabrina's threat to Roku is that and only that right now: a threat. This is an opportunity to trade accordingly :) Happy tendies ya'll!",2020-06-26
hlu2y3,134,130,wallstreetbets,Q2 Update from the Desk of Jerome Powell,0.84,1594011452.0,1593982652.0,"Dear WSB,

# TL;DR: I told you so, we’re going up more, then down - here is how to play it.

Its me JPOW again, maybe you missed [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzlv03/an_open_letter_to_wsb_from_the_desk_of_jerome/) \- or maybe it was too long for the average autist. If you would have made these trades, and rolled like I said, you wouldn’t be broke. Get it?

Everything I said in my previous post, came to pass economically, but I must admit I was wrong about Trump. He chopped and screwed it up bigly, but all good, we can pivot right quick.

The left is going to make sure we keep these wheels turning - it doesn’t make a difference who is in the White House.

# WE'RE GOING UP

**Second Wave.** I don’t care about waves, I control the tide. Remember how everyone was scared about the first wave? Notice how they aren’t about the second?

**Uncertainty.** Not knowing “what will happen with COVID” is so much worse for equities than not knowing. The market hates uncertainty. We have already seen what COVID can do economically - countries have made their plans and accepted their fate. Will more COVID damage the economy? Yes, but the uncertainty of how and how much have been drastically reduced.

**Trump is Done.** You should be able to see it on his face, but the guy is honestly pretty stupid and is a bit tired. It was fine to be stupid and confident, but now he is stupid and weak - and America can smell it. Remember in 2016 when a bunch of people said they were voting for Hillary but obviously switched to Trump when they were in the booth? Watch the opposite happen this time with Trump supporters who can’t admit publicly they turned on him - but will vote for Biden in the booth. He ded.

**Biden is Whatever.** Don’t think Biden is going to slow this train down at all. Biden is just the manifestation of the moderate left establishment - Biden is a Clinton/Obama mashup that is more than willing to play ball. Biden poses no economic threat and I don’t think he has the balls to try and replace me.

**Pelosi Will Chill.** Biden and Pelosi will finally start being able to execute on what I have been saying - keep printing. Congress did their thing, but if we are going to keep going up they need to do more. Pelosi has been fighting the conservatives to keep the stimulus out of corporate hands - once she can print the way she wants the working class will get what they need for perpetuity.

**Printer Prints.** Remember how Obama/Biden pushed the FED to print? Then Trump pushed the FED to print? You better believe Biden, Pelosi and I will make it rain. The economy is fucked, but we can roll out socialism and prop up asset prices at the same time - easy peasy.

**The Dollar is Changing**. I printed a lot - more than usual. It is going to take some time to work through, but buying power of the dollar is going down. We are pretty front loaded on fresh dollars, and I am down to print more, but eventually this dilutes those dollars in all the middle/lower class people’s savings accounts. I just can’t print too much more than other countries - if the US prints an outsized proportion of currency the dollar will fall bigly.

**More Cases = More Printing**. Haven’t you guys noticed how everything has been a bit backwards since the March lows? That is when bad news became good news and good news became bad news - remember? Record unemployment and stocks go up right? That is because when bad shit happens, I can act unilaterally to just print it away. Guess what happens if more bad shit happens?

**Wealth Transfer.** Every time this happens, the retail investor, the 401k, and uninformed invest at the last minute. We need all that money on the sidelines to come in first, before the collapse in asset values happens. If they don’t get their money in, we can’t transfer the wealth. If we can’t transfer the wealth, what are we doing here? Wait for a greater retail wave of “reinvestment” before thinking the crash is here.

**No Defaults.** Defaults are only going to happen when people can’t service those debts. As long as people pay, the wheels keep turning. Congress gave the poor people money to pay the rich people, I cut debt costs for the rich people, we should be good for a while (notice, for a while).

**Take From the Bottom.** The lower and middle class can take it. We just need to roll this out at the expense of the lower classes. Remember, as long as we keep them working a W2 and paying their mortgage they stay the “working class” and we get to stay the “investing class.” The government will keep stealing from the working class future, to prop up the investing class’s present wealth.

**Market Collapse Delayed**. We have corrections, recessions, depressions when there is a “de-everaging.” This means, debts are forgiven, restructured, losses are realized. That won’t happen for a bit because we are going to keep dripping dollars and relief to the middle class and poor to keep the wheels turning.

**TINA.** *There Is No Alternative* to US Equities. Underpinning this whole landscape is the fact that all other economies, and their respective currencies, and their central governments, are all equally fucked. So if everyone is fucked, were the least fucked and our debt and equities are still “safe havens”

**Imports/Exports.** The future decline in the dollar is going to help companies which export and hurt those which import. Don’t sleep on this concept - it will impact the next 3-4 years.

**More Debt the Better.** Everyone gets scared of being over leveraged, but I will just buy it out. Take on the debt, and lets juice earnings. Don’t forget that even if sales go down because of a recession, profits can go up if I single handedly cut debt service of every company in the US.

**Companies:** Look for individual companies well positioned for a world of remote work, AI, robotics, internet of things, space, e-commerce, domestic manufacturing. Avoid importers, healthcare, travel, banking. When boomers die, their heirs will divest from boomer companies. Invest in the future.

**We’re Fine.** America will be fine, but things will be permanently different. I just printed bigly, and will likely print more. Someone has to pay for it (old shit companies, young people, middle class, the future) but there are going to be major short term winners.

**Melt Up**. Every big economic contraction is preceded by exuberance. Are we feeling exuberant yet? Not really, people are still scared. Stock prices are back up, but no one is confident. We need to get confident first, then start melting up. There are not enough pigs in the market yet, the slaughter can not yet start.

SPY $375-$400 November.

—

# WE'RE GOING DOWN

**Market Collapse Realized**. Take note, the market collapse is coming when the medical solution is realized. This will signal new monetary policy, decrease in stimulus and an expectation that we “Actually get back to work and fix the economy.” As soon as this process starts, consumer spending will go down, borrowing will go down, people will sell financial assets to cover debt obligations, investors will rotate into bonds as rates eventually get increased.

**Vaccine = Party is Over.** This is a big one guys, when “the real solution” to COVID is medically available my financial solution is going to “peak.” I might be able to do a little more, but when the vaccine is available I have to ratchet this shit back slowly but surely. I can’t drive this thing off the cliff, just need to steal from the poor and future generations as needed to make sure today is still good to go.

**The Crash:** Yes, it is coming, but we need to melt up bigly first, then crash slowly from there. The FED has the markets propped up, but the American consumer and global economy won’t be able to support it at these levels - there simply won’t be enough money transacting and GDP will decline.

**Stocks Will Go Down When:**

* Things go back to normal. Thats when we have to start paying for this damage.
* Stimulus ends. We will go straight down.
* Me saying anything other than “full speed ahead” at press conferences.
* Tech stocks showing weakness.
* If I let a medium company go bankrupt. This means some capitalism rules apply.
* The investing class stops investing. Unemployment isn’t a big deal, be worried when executives start getting pinched.
* Corporate taxes are increased.
* Capital gains taxes are increased.

**The Big Short:** I would wait, but I think this one is pretty obvious guys. There are a ton of growth stocks, mainly in tech, with impossible valuations - these will get hit the hardest. Look for this charts that go straight up starting March 23rd. Take your pick:

hlvz9p,52,61,wallstreetbets,The Economist: Value investing is overrated because the DotCom Boom and Bust.,0.85,1594018131.0,1593989331.0,"[Here is the full article](https://outline.com/4D74bE)(outline form, so no paywall).

While the whole article is fantastic (also you can break out a couple quotes from Horace afterwards, which will confuse people who are busy staring at our drooling and dope bicycle helmets), here are the key two paragraphs:

>Perhaps you can have too much sobriety. For the past decade buying **“value” stocks has been an unrewarding strategy.** America’s stockmarket is dominated by a handful of technology companies, whose stocks trade on steep multiples of earnings and book value. The current recession has not changed matters. **The fallen have not been restored. If anything, those in honour have more of it. Value investors, meanwhile, are unmoved.** This begs a heretical thought. If the dotcom boom and bust had not happened, would value investing have quite the same moral authority today?  
>  
>**In the late 1990s ideas about fundamental value went by the wayside. A bubble blew up. It then burst dramatically. The bust was a painful lesson for investors. But perhaps some lessons were learnt a little too well. “When fools shun one set of faults”, wrote Horace, “they run into the opposite one.”**

... I feel a little targeted by that last line.

*7/2:*  Bought 100 shares @ 2.60 today will buy 100 more  tomorrow @ limit buy of 2.45. Will moniter throughout the next few weeks to see if this is a long buy or if i will short, as china has a new swine flu with pandemic potential and has been opening and closing cities still due to corona which is beneficial for ecommerce. They are similar to Alibaba but sell memberships as well and use members to promote products effectively cutting ad cost. Next earning report 8/27/20

*Ion Geophysical (IO)* company that does research on oil and fuel alternatives as well as provide tech for seismic mapping to assist oil and gas companies in defining and developing drill sites 
*7/2* Entered market with 100 shares @ $2.60 a share, will probably short this next week once it hits $3.50. I believe the stock will rise next week as crude oil prices should drop, especially if airlines will plummet as predicted.

*Second sight (EYES)* entered @ $1.01 x 200 shares 
Will probably hold this for a while. I bought this as kind of a troll one night when i was drunk cause i read a bunch of stories about people getting their eyes shot out in the riots..... and yes they make bionic eyes... no further comment

A sold IPO entrance point as its the second largest grocer in the U.S. right after Kroger. Company has been posting (+) returns the last 3 years. New CEO from PepsiCo. Good projection with potential 120% upside. 

7/2 Entered today with 50 shares @ $15.70, will probably hold this for a while and buy more as it seems like a solid longterm investment.

The  only way to look at Amazon's business is to separate it out into three  very large businesses, I will break down each and why I believe the  company as a whole is undervalued:

A/  Retail & Marketplace - this is the consumer facing portion of their  business where Amazon buys at wholesale and then sells to shoppers. The  latter (Marketplace), is the faster growing and more profitable  business unit, now accounting for over 55% of all orders. Sellers use  FBA and sell their products to shoppers directly where Amazon takes a  \~7%-\~15% fee depending on the category.

B/  AWS – fast growing cloud business operating at 26% gross margins with a  $50B run-rate growing 30% YoY (do you know how crazy it was typing that  out?)

C/ Amazon Media Group -  this includes their fast growing advertising business, Twitch, Amazon  Music, and Amazon Prime Video. This is the least-known portion of their  business, but is the fastest growing with highest margins.

**Retail & Marketplace**

There’s  not much to say here, other than Amazon does roughly \~$250B in sales  and growing 30% YoY on average here. For reference, Walmart does \~$500B.  Even if you gave the retail/marketplace portion of Amazon’s business a  conservative valuation of $500B (2x revenue), it’s a very large  business. Now, take into consideration how much they are emphasizing 3P  sellers and private label products, Amazon’s profitability metrics will  greatly improve in this business as it lowers its overhead so the  business in value will continue to grow. This also fails to mention  their breadth of their FBA business and how many sellers use the product  offering. If anyone has sold anything on Amazon or knows someone that  does, 99% of sellers use FBA because of how easy, convenient, and  cost-effective it is. With the tailwinds associated with COVID, this  business will likely surpass 30% YoY growth, which is just incredible  growth #s for a business this large. In comparison, Walmart is usually  <10% YoY growth when it comes to their revenue metrics.

My valuation of the business = \~$500B - $750B

**AWS**

AWS  is projected to do around $50B-$60B in sales for 2020. Latest public  analyst valuations peg it around \~$500B, which I believe is unfair. For  reference, MongoDB is trading at 20x revenue, Crowdstrike, DOCU,  Datadog, all SAAS/cloud providers are trading at 20x or even more!

Valuing  AWS as a standalone business for anything less than $500B would be  under-representing just how large and fast-growing this business is.  Growing at 30% YoY at a $50B run-rate is just unfathomable. If we were  looking at this at a 20x revenue multiple (which I believe it would be  valued at a 20x multiple if it was a standalone company), AWS would be  at a $1 trillion market cap alone. It's the de-facto choice for  start-ups, even as Azure continues to take customers away, AWS is the  leader for all new tech/start-up companies and will continue to see  massive tailwinds as the entire economy shifts to cloud-based offerings.  COVID has also accelerated this business as usage is undoubtedly up for  their core segment of customers, while customers that are most affected  (restaurants) are not really AWS-like customers.

My valuation of this business unit = $650B

**Amazon Media Group**

Advertising  – Many people don’t know much about this business, but you know the  products you click on while you’re shopping around on Amazon? It’s safe  to say a bunch of those products are paying Amazon significant dollars  on a PPC basis (pay-per-click) to surface higher in the search results.  This business generated $14 billion in revenue in 2019. Google, the  leader in advertising, is valued at 10x revenue, so this business alone  is probably worth close to $16B after 2020 alone. $FB did $73B in  revenue trailing 12 months, this would mean FB is about 4.5x the size of  Amazon's Advertising business ALONE. I just compared FB as a whole to  Amazon's ""side-business"" in Advertising.

Twitch  – this is a tough business to value, but Needham and others have pegged  it at \~$15 billion alone. It’s the clear leader in online streaming and  Microsoft recently shutdown Mixer (their Twitch competitor). The  possibilities here are endless, look for Amazon Advertising to plug in  their data capabilities to target viewers of live streaming events with  products soon. Twitch will soon be merged into the advertising ecosystem  to begin serving targeted ads to viewers. Think ad-supported streams  where there is some sort of revenue share back to the streamers. This  feeds into the ecosystem where content creators make more $ (won't  leave), advertisers get access to a valuable niche audience, and Amazon  reaps the benefits of high-value/profitable advertising at 65% gross  margins.

Prime Video – the most  surprising stat for Prime Video is that 20% of Prime members sign up  primarily for Amazon Prime Video. With over 150M subscribers, analysts  peg the value of Prime Video alone at $200b. Amazon has also entered the  OTT ad-supported streaming market with IMDB TV (ad-supported free  television). This is exclusive inventory that Amazon can offer to brands  to advertise on, and compete directly with ROKU, which is valued at 15X  revenue.

Lastly, Amazon Music has  30M subscribers. Apple has 60M, and Spotify 100M. Amazon Music (Who the  fuck uses it, is already half the size of Apple Music and about a 3rd  of Spotify...)

Because all the  businesses aren’t broken out, it’s tough valuing the entire Media Group  business, but it honestly could be in the range of anywhere b/w  $300B-$600B off the synergies and potential for expansion. Again, as a  standalone business, this suite of products would have public market  investors salivating over the growth potential.

**Hidden Value (Areas of Opportunity)**

I  went this entire DD without mentioning the huge competitive MOATs  around voice (Echo = the leader), as well as their entire  logistics/ground fulfillment network, Amazon GO stores, and their  venture in the medical health space. Because it's nearly impossible to  value these things as a whole, you can basically pencil w/e you want  here from a valuation perspective.

*Amazon Retail/Marketplace Business - $650B*

*AWS - $650B*

*Amazon Media Group - $400B*

*Hidden  Value - Go stores, Fulfillment Network, Self-driving, Echo (voice),  Whole Foods, Medical Venture with JP Morgan & Berkshire = $300B*

**Total = $2B**

TLDR:  Amazon is undervalued at a $1.6B market cap, and the stock will be up  to $3500 in the next year. Business units valued as stand-alone  companies would be valued way more, growth potential is endless, and  COVID has accelerated trends in favor of Amazon for the next 5 yrs.

Very small list today. Not many good gaps. We saw a big fade off yesterday. The SPY and QQQ looked great for follow through but IWM is having trouble breaking back over resistance. If the market pulls pack more today, I may try to jump in UVXY for a quick trade but we could possibly be setting up for an inside day. Either way, today is a day where patience can pay off. Look for good entries and wait for the market to establish some sort of direction before jumping in. Quality over quantity. Hopefully things pick back up in the next couple weeks when companies start releasing earnings reports. If you don't feel comfortable, don't feel bad about sitting out and watching. This is a good day to run scans after the open to find movers. Good luck trading and have a good weekend. See you Monday

In a Kangaroo market like this I find myself looking to SPY for entry points on calls/puts and try not to go against the grain..

The technical picture suggesting a move to SPY 315 and a break above that would send SPY to 327.50  
\*But from there, the index could pull back to a low of around 300  
\*A break below 296.50 opens for significant downside  
and we would expect to see 273 within a few trading sessions

JPOW also said he sees a three stage economic path..  
stage 1 - the shutdown with sharp drop in activity - ends in June  
stage 2 - the bounceback with sharp increase in MoM economic data - ends in July  
stage 3 - we find that the economy is ""well short"" of pre-pandemic levels and go 'oh shit'

\*PPP funds running out in June for business that secured loans in April.. (PPP deadline extended to Aug 8th)  
\*Federal bans on evictions in federally assisted properties ends July 25  
\*Federal unemployment extra $600 ends July 31st

\*The markets will be prepping next month for the first release of 2nd quarter GDP which has been   
projected to drop anywhere from 30% to 50%  
prior trends..  
Q2 2019: +2.0%  
Q3 2019: +2.1%  
Q4 2019: +2.1%  
Q1 2020: -5.0%

\*The HEROES Act, if passed by the senate, could include..  
second round of stimulus checks  
extension of the $600 increase in unemployment

What to expect as banks report earnings:  
\-expect another big hit to earnings as they set aside more money to cover loan losses  
\-a boost in fee income from elevated trading activity  
\-Banks not allowed to raise dividends or perform share buy-backs through Q3 2020  
\*Wells Fargo & Co. WFC appears at greatest risk for a dividend cut among the “big six” U.S. banks

\*analysis of the government data found that just over 554,000 small businesses who got PPP funds   
reported retaining zero jobs - raising concerns about how many will be eligible for forgiveness in the future

\*Consumer borrowing fell dropped BIGLY in April, less in May, and even less in June.. But use of consumer credit is down YoY for each month of Q2  
\*Revolving credit, like credit cards, declined at a nearly 29% clip in May. In April, revolving credit shrank by a record 65% as people paid down debt.  
\*For companies that rely on transaction volume and late fees for revenue generation.. this will hurt Q2 earnings (MA, V, etc.)

\*Yet nonrevolving credit, typically auto and student loans, actually rose 2.3%. Auto sales rebounded   
during the month (ALLY CVNA)

\*As Bloomberg cautions, the pace of recent Chinese gains matches the market’s melt-up that started in the final weeks of 2014.. before a huge crash in SHCOMP.. 

\*Global restaurant traffic data via OpenTable shows little improvement in late June  
OpenTable recently warned that 25% of all U.S. restaurants would never reopen

Energy: A Deloitte analysis has found that almost a third of U.S. shale producers are technically insolvent with crude at $35 a barrel.  
Analysts predict 250 oil/gas/shale may go bankrupt with companies now filing for bankruptcy at the fastest pace since 2009

(COF) Capital One said nearly three-quarters of its $6.24 billion exposure to the oil and gas industry   
lies with companies responsible for exploration and production.

(BAM) Broofield Asset Management tenants will go bankrupt.. but BAM has requested forbearance  
on the loans BAM owes for 12-months..

\-------

\*of course, any news on PPP-extension, more unemployment checks, or a vaccine could always cause a rally

\*\*\*If you must buy puts, buy them on IWM, not SPY.. FANG will have retard strength as long as printer go brrrr.. and JPOW buys AAPL bonds..",2020-07-10

From what i understand ROKU has a set of OTT hardware (dongles, set top boxes and tv sets) with their own software, and some licensed content streaming through channels which are accessible through their hardware - is this correct so far or did i misunderstand/forget anything?

what i do not understand: what is their moat? in my understanding this is pretty similar to offerings from apple, google and amazon, no? also, pretty much every tv set sold in the last ten years has been connectable, why would one need additional hardware in the future ,unless they have a very old tv set? ROKUs content seems to not be exclusive, so that does not sound like an advantage vs competition either?

Hello Day Trader

I’m going try and start posting my watchlist and plays each day, drawing helps me out understanding a little more and makes me practice. Im not a professional trader, im guy that works from home and play options during the day, i have a small account $2500. I don’t play anything over $250 (10% of my account in one play) still have my 8-5 jobs. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask. Please remember this is for educational purposes and is not advice to buy, this is only my opinion.

BA

Looking to break that down trend line, any pull back to 175.41 area, take it long , with volume this can hit $190. Stops are around 172-173. Looking to buy 7/17 190c.

[https://imgur.com/a/geNjYNx](https://imgur.com/a/geNjYNx)

ROKU

I think roku still has some gas in the tank, it held that 151 support. Any pull back to 151 area and holds take it long to $159.80 area. If you have more than 1 contract sell half and see if it pushes through the resistance. Roku needs volume, keep on eye on it, ride the 9 ema. Looking to buy 7/17 170c.

DDOG

Any pull back to 95 area, take it long, you can always wait to break that pennant and take it long but risk/reward is less as it goes into all time highs. Stops below 95 confirmed. Looking into 7/17 100c

[https://imgur.com/a/kfRuW7v](https://imgur.com/a/kfRuW7v)

FB

Any pull back to 240-239 area, take it long, stops below 239, if you can hold all the way to 236 and it holds you could doble down on it. Breaking that downtrend, should push. Looking to buy 7/17 250c

hzdszl,82,123,investing,If you're in companies relying on ad money - be long or get out now,0.9,1595968226.0,1595939426.0,"Out of the three biggest advertising networks two had their earnings calls recently, Publicis last week and Omnicom today. Long story short: Publicis was pretty bad in Europe, [Omnicom was terrible worldwide](https://twitter.com/gideonspanier/status/1288080966217596928). What's more, Publicis declined to give guidance for the rest of the year, Omnicom said they weren't expecting the situation to get better for the rest of the year (no word about 2021).

You may not know these companies, but when it comes to advertising budgets they are in charge for buying media for the biggest clients in the world. Along with WPP, Dentsu and Havas (part of Vivendi) they are probably responsible for about 75% of media buys worldwide.

What does that mean and why does it matter to you: Some of the biggest companies in the world and some investors darlings depend heavily on media spend which is likely to be down at least until the end of the year. Facebook basically has no other relevant source of income, Google depends on advertising with over 90% of their revenue. Adtech companies like The Trade Desk or Magnite make money only when ads are being bought through their technology, and others like Roku have a relevant advertising business which will suffer as well when advertisers reduce their budgets. TV networks, out of home networks, magazine publishers and so on obviously facing the same problems.

Most of these companies have good products which will be doing ok in the long run, earnings calls will not be pretty though, especially with the high expectations which have been priced in lately. Any business trading at higher price per share than early January (when valuations were quite optimistic already) will have to face the music in the coming weeks when the truth is out. Prepare yourselves.

*I am the furthest thing from a financial advisor you can imagine.  These are my thoughts.  Do your own DD of course.*

\*\*\*\* 

**Tendie Stimulus 2 post-mortum** 

For myself last week, **SPOT** and **MRNA** were my big duds I had to dump quick quick, and these **MSFT** bags I'm holding from EOD Friday are getting miiiiighty heavy--but jury is still out.  I think and hope MSFT/TikTok pushback from WH is more negotiation tactic than anything to get more companies to divest (more on that later).  **CRWD, PYPL, SQ, all printed** for me, with CRWD printing very bigly. **The week for me was up \~110%** (moves tracked in time-stamped edits and on Twitter).

*That said, let's dive in to what may have an impact this week, starting with the Stimulus*  

*\*\*\** 

**Stimulus Talk Updates: Checks, UI Extension, Lawsuit Liability, and Deadline**  

* **$1,200 checks are a done deal**, **whats important?:** 
   * 1) $75,000 income cap remains intact 
   * 2) now paying additional $500 for ALL dependents (previously 17 and under)
   * 3) these stimulus checks cannot be paid out until a deal is reached
* **UI extension, BENEFITS OFFICIALLY EXPIRED FRIDAY:** Dems have not indicated they will budge off $600.  Repubs came back with $200.  The Democrats Mutombo rejected that offer and the GOP came back with a $600 one week extension offer.  True to her word, Pelosi rejected the temporary offer; no ""piece meal"" approaches will be accepted by the Dems because they have the upper hand.  It's a bold stategy, Cotton, let's see if it pays off.  
   * ^(NOTE: Blue states, such as CA, are reaching into their own coffers to extend the UI.  So, look for whether your state has committed to continuing it's unemployment enhancement, potentially.)
* **Liability protection from COVID lawsuits**: McConnell has gone from saying this is non-negotiable to saying there is some wiggle room.  Lawsuits are already beginning to flow in, according the WSJ.  Look for this to become a talking point for GOP to try to establish some form of leverage.

***Stimulus talks scale of importance: 7/10*** 

The Stimulus Negotiations from last week have convinced some (imo wrongly) that stimulus talks going sideways is just an extrapolating factor that can only move markets downward in conjunction with other economic turmoil, and that the stimulus going poorly by itself doesn't move markets--the case cited for this is that UI benefits ran out on Friday, and shit still popped off bigly green.  But a deeper look at Friday reveals that it was actually a red day across sectors if you take big tech companies with heavy weight out of the picture. I'm not cherry picking; **had the Big 4 earnings not been scheduled the day before UI ran out, Friday could've been a blood bath.** 

***How Stimulus talks may play out, and play out in the market:*** 

The Senate has been firm on not extending their session past the scheduled August 7th break.  If that stands, **although the logistics of a deal seem like it's impossible to complete before Friday, I believe they will; it's mutually assured political destruction otherwise**, which would pale in comparison to the budget negotiation crisis earlier in the decade.  I am looking for Pelosi to offer concessions on Liability Protections, which is important to GOP, in exchange for an extended UI offer of $400-$500 through EOY, with a grace period of continued high enhancements (probably $500 or $600) through mid-August or until checks arrive.  This allows Americans to properly prepare by spending it all on more iPhones, as well as receive backpay for the lapsed week starting 7/31. 

**My hunch is Monday will be a news blood bath regarding the extension working out which will give SPY a big morning-afternoon dip, followed by recovery EOD into Tuesday.**  I can see it now, dozens of news stories profiling moms who are losing their benefits and saying their kids will starve, they'll miss rent, etc.  *If you're holding 8/3's or FDs, I'd strongly urge you to consider taking the profits at open if we open green from overnight trading.* 

***Eyeball test on how it will affect markets*****:** I fish multiple times a week, and without fail *Walmart has a line around the block on Mondays and Tuesdays even larger than ones on Saturdays (UI benefit payments are on Monday)*.  Also, the electronics department is always completely raided of EVERYTHING.  Retail electronics (home computers, phones, tablets, gaming systems so ROKU, SONY, etc) will likely falter bigly if talks seem to sputter. 

\*\*\*

**The Fed Repo Schedule: say it with me-- Lick-WID-it-TEE (scale of importace, 9/10)** 

If you haven't, you may want to check out my https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hqn08u/dd\_new\_fed\_repo\_scheduleanalysis\_for\_what\_it/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x  on additional liquidity in markets through what I refer to as ""pump days"", ""double pump days"", ""rollover dates"", and repo bids.

**We are in line for a ""double pump"" on Tuesday**.  For a long period this meant, almost always, SPY would go green.  However in June, probably due to improving market conditions, the bids on those repo operations stopped (this meant the fed was offering the money, and people weren't taking it.  I took a look at this week's chart, available [here](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&startDate=01/01/2000&enddate=01/01/2000) and noticed something interesting:   


[1 bid was entered Friday](https://preview.redd.it/9pu0khhz0oe51.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=011b415534c558be4783b655faa93669451c9e18)

[1 overnight bid Thursday](https://preview.redd.it/vb5gxihz0oe51.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d627b138accf17aae67620576169d2dfc360242)

[ 8 overnight bids Wednesday](https://preview.redd.it/0tfg8mhz0oe51.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c59893f356d85c4c54309fb5d84f260b6990aef3)

**They're taking the money again.**  This was the first week in the past two months where we saw bids entered on overnight operations 3 days in a row.  Duds mostly, but big action on Thursday.  There are two ways to take this  

1.	**Liquidity being back is a bad thing** because it means that borrowers are trying to stave off economic turmoil and a coming leg down.  This theory is bolstered by the large amount of put option activity that has been happening in August
2.	**Liquidity being back is a good thing** because it means, well, more liquidity.

I did a search on liquidity operations the week of the June 11th mini crash, and there were massive amounts of bids preceding the fall (admittedly last week's levels are NOWHERE near that, but it's more than zero).  So that could, *in theory*, bolster the bearish argument through logic of:

 ^(increased liquidity operations+more put activity in large blocks =) **^(coming fall)**.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ff0hmt872oe51.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a488fdde05a0e4b7299d94e23b7d596145ad4d74

At least through Wednesday, however, I'll be going with the old quote: Don't Fight the Fed. I'm bullish on this liquidity for now given our current relative stabilization. I'll be looking closely at what the bids are as the week progresses, and when I see a good opportunity dip on Monday I will enter **SPY 327c 8/7.**  Again, depending on the bids, I will likely hold through **Wednesday afternoon, then look to take advantage of Stimulus gloom and doom posturing with a VXX 28c or 29c 8/7** depending also on how low VXX is at that point. 

 \*\*\* 

**GYNA!!!! (Importance: 10/10, fallout is NOT priced in)** 

As a I predicted, the fuckery with China is not over.  MSFT is in the crosshairs, which I'll get to in a moment, but more importantly [Pompeo on Sunday said they about to talk big shit on Chinese companies beyond TikTok this week](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/02/politics/mike-pompeo-trump-action-tiktok/index.html). As we all know, China likes to reciprocate, and I genuinely feel like this is the only market factor right now not ""priced in"", as people say.  This, in combination with other factors, is why I am bearish on probably Wednesday EOD-Friday morning.  [Considering that China will likely retaliate against NOK and ERIC for the Huawei drama in UK we caused](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-may-retaliate-against-nokia-and-ericsson-if-eu-countries-move-to-ban-huawei-11595250557), I am playing this Wednesday or Thursday with:  

**VXX 28c or 29c Wednesday or Thursday,** depending on how low it is and what day Trump anounces Gyna news   
 If China says they will retaliate, Thursday maybe: **NOK 8/14 5p** (if they break 5 convinvingly by Wednesday) 

\*\*\*  
**My 'Scared Money Don't Make None Get Rich or Die Trying High-Risk Bet of the Week'**   
 Vaccine pump is coming bigly to the rescue at some point this week, but I don't hae faith in MRNA (see previous scathing DD). PFE and other big companies are pretty lazy movers outside  of trial results, and the others I am kind meh on. 

**So I am playing vaccine pump indirectly through airlines, specifically ALK.**  Yes, more bad COVID news is coming out, and I'm hoping that happens on Monday AM so I can hop in EOD or Tuesday morning once the gloom and doom for the week is over.  Better cash flow than the others, better managed, equivealent growth potential, and more resistant to daily COVID trends than others according to the charts.  If I can get some red on them Monday, EOD I'm going bigly on  

**ALK 8/21 35c** and dumping after a pop  

**\*\*\*other shit\*\*\*** 

How I'm playing earnings this week: 

**SQ** has a lot of chatter.  Ive been holding it for this run-up, and am going to dump right before ER, then pick it back up at a dip the next day.  Why?  

* ***SQ is good, cash app is explosive, but SQ just isn't PYPL*** because they do so much work with POS sale systems in stores that are shuttered.  That said, retail at many places has actually been better than expected and small business are integrating SQ into their online-facing order systems at a rapid pace.  I also think that, like PYPL, their forward guidance will smack based on Direct Deposit options and a broadening base of users from UI extensions, etc.  Plus, you know, fucking E-thots.  Anecdotally, lower income brackets also seem prefer Cash app to PYPL/Venmo, and that is the group that saw the most benefit from UI (if you know why please explain in comments).  I still don't know for certain it'll beat cheeks though because of in-store POS losses, so I'm going to take my profits on Wednesday, then buy back in once IV settles for a nice little run through next week.
* ***Also wary of SQ earnings because PYPL ""only"" popped 6% AH*** with jaw dropping ER.  Then it had a quick, 5 minute morning run up before crashing back.  I consider PYPL the SQ 'best case scenario' comparison.  A potential 6% pop on crazy IV just isn't worth the dice roll, imo.
* ***Current position:*** **8/7 32c I'll sell Wednesday before ER**.  **Thursday** will pick up an **8/21 135c** or higher if they do kill earnings and explode.

**For all the other big ones like ATVI, NET, etc, I'm just going to see who pops, hope for a morning dip next day, then go all in Friday with some ODTE on a popular one like net**.  Partly a logic play, partly AAPL fomo.   


**These fucking MSFT bags** 

Really hoping Trump and Satiya don't eiffel tower me on these **8/7 205c**'s I picked up on Friday, but right now ya boy is feeling like a potential spit roast.  I'm just going to grind it out--I have faith TikTok deal will get done this week, as Trump likely just wants to give Chinese companies a redscare and show them that selling to Americans is the only thing that will save them. 

  
 \*\*\* 

 !!!!!**TLDR!!!!!** 

This week has an unnerving amount of factors in the air including Stimulus Negotiations, increased liquidity operations utilization through Repo, and GYNA.  I believe the beginning of the week will see a run on liquidity to boost markets after a falter through mid day Monday. ** But I am overall bearish for the week**. I think that money will shift to airlines and other beaten down markets at some point, and will play it for pop but not hold longer. 

**Currently bagholding with confidence:** 

**MSFT** 205c 8/7 

**SQ** 132c 8/7 (pre earnings dumping)

**Beginning of week buying during dip:** 

**SPY** 327c 8/7, 8/14 

**ALK** 35c 8/21

**SQ** 135c 8/14 (post earnings buy)

**EOW** 

**VXX** 8/7 28c or 29c depending how low it is 

**NOK** 8/14 5p (if it crosses 5 big beginning of week)

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 3rd, 2020.

# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/the-jobs-report-and-congressional-politics-may-matter-more-for-markets-than-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The market could lose some of its exuberance in the week ahead as the calendar turns to August, and investors await Friday’s July employment report and keep their eyes on Washington.
*****
> The focus will also be squarely on politicians, as Congress struggles to find a middle ground on a new fiscal spending package and decide the fate of the $600 a week unemployment supplement that was set to expire July 31. Former vice president Joe Biden is also expected to name his running mate in the coming week.
*****
> The jobs data will be crucial, particularly since the number of people filing for unemployment benefits has been edging higher, instead of falling back, as expected. According to Refinitiv, about 1.36 million new jobs are expected, well below the 4.8 million added in June, and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.7% from 11.1%.
*****
> Trading around the report could be volatile, since some economists expect more than 2 million jobs were added, and some even see flat or negative payrolls.
*****
> Stocks have done well for the month of July, with the S&P 500 finishing at 3,271, a gain of 5.5%. The Nasdaq has performed the best, rising 6.8% for the month to 10,745, after a 3.7% gain for the past week.
*****
> “August has traditionally been a challenging month for investors,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The market is entering what historically has been the worst two months for stocks.
*****
> According to Stovall, the S&P 500 has been higher in August 53% of the time, and its average move is a gain of just 0.01%, going back to World War II. September is worse, down 0.51% on average, and up just 48% of the time.
*****
> In presidential election years, however the odds for August gains are better, as it rose 63% of the time and 73%, when the incumbent is up for re-election.
*****
> There are also about 120 S&P 500 companies reporting earnings, but the big earnings show for markets was this past week when four of the five biggest tech giants all reported Thursday afternoon. Three of those stocks — Apple, Amazon and Facebook — surged, helping Nasdaq outperform Friday with a more than 1.5% gain.
*****
> # Earnings scorecard
> “We’re only a month into the reporting period, and things are going to become less and less important from an earnings perspective,” said Stovall. “I think investors are sort of disappointed in that the bar was set so low for second quarter earnings that expectations were that we were going to see a lot of companies beat, which we have. But we were also going to see a gradual uplift of earnings expectations for forward quarters. We’re not seeing that.”
*****
> Eighty-two percent of the companies reporting so far have beaten estimates, well above the average 65%, according to Refinitiv. The earnings decline is now looking closer to 33% from an initial 40%, and tech, which has been leading the market is one of the best performers. Profits for the sector now look to be up 1.4%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
*****
> Because the tech names have contributed so much to market gains, their earnings were an important test for the market, and they didn’t disappoint. But they didn’t manage to pull up the whole market very far on Friday.
*****
> Among the names reporting in the coming week are a diverse group, including Disney, ViacomCBS, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Berkshire Hathaway, AIG, Clorox, and Wayfair, to name a few.
*****
> # Politics now in play
> “The earnings story is over. My call had been once we had gotten through the earnings season, we would be more vulnerable to a sustainable pullback,” said Barry Knapp, Ironside Macroeconomics managing partner and director of research. “Obviously, it’s volatility season, but it’s also an election year. ... We’re more vulnerable to that next week and earnings won’t hold us up.”
*****
> Knapp said if President Donald Trump and Republicans do not begin to perform better in the polls by Labor Day, the market is likely to focus on what a Democratic win would mean for taxes and regulation. That could be a negative for stocks.
*****
> “If he hasn’t made headway by then, it’s likely he’s done.That’s about the point when things become pretty set in stone. The market will presume that’s the case,” Knapp said.
*****
> The politics of the stimulus package could also reverberate through markets, until it looks like the Senate Republicans and House Democrats can find common ground.
*****
> The two sides look to be at a standoff, but an agreement is still expected in early August. The market is particularly watching to see what happens with the enhanced unemployment benefits. Republicans have proposed cutting it to $200, but Democrats support keeping it.
*****
> # The economy
> Cutting the size of the payments back might be good for the labor market and persuade more workers to return to work, some strategists say. However, there is also concern that the funding has helped stimulate the economy and keep the unemployed from defaulting on loans and payments. Consumer spending on goods in June was even higher than last year, and that was also seen as getting a lift from stimulus.
*****
> Besides the jobs report, there are other important data like ISM manufacturing on Monday. There are also monthly vehicle sales Monday, and ISM nonmanufacturing data Wednesday.
*****
> “I think the macro data is going to be fine next week,” said Knapp. “I’m not in the camp that thinks the payroll number is going to be negative.”
*****
> NatWest Markets economist Kevin Cummins is one of the economists who expects the jobs gains to be much smaller than the past two months. He expects the payrolls to come in at just 200,000. “You look at jobless claims, and you see a stalling out,” he said. “The Fed is right. There is significant downside risk to the economy.”
*****
> # A trade to watch
> Treasury yields, in the 2-year to 7-year range, fell to new lows in the past week. The 10-year yield, not yet at a record low, was also falling and was at 0.53% Friday. At the same time, the dollar was down more than 1% on the week and 4% for the month.
*****
> Gold was a beneficiary of the lower interest rates, weaker dollar trade, rising about 5% for the week and 10% for the month.
*****
> Strategist say investors are reacting to super-low interest rates, concerns about the economy, and the possibility that huge government spending will send inflation higher.
*****
> Investors are also jumping into inflation-protected bonds. According to Refinitiv’s Lipper, inflation-protected bond funds took in $271 million of net new money for the fund-flows week ended July 29, the sixth week of gains. About $1 billion went into the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, (GLD) in the last week, Lipper said.
*****
> During this time period, the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities funds recorded their two best weekly net inflows ever with increases of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the fund-flows weeks of June 24 and July 1.
*****
> Lipper said investors started to put money into TIPS funds in the middle of the second quarter, and the flows have been . net positive in 11 out of 13 weeks since the beginning of May. This its second-worst quarterly net outflows ever as oil prices slumped in the first quarter.
*****
> “I think this is going to be a much more inflationary decade. It will start out slowly. [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell is right that more forces are putting downward pressure on inflation at present. But the market looks past that,” said Knapp. “The big story in 2021 will be the recovery of inflation. You’re already seeing it in import prices.”

> # August: Top NASDAQ & Russell 2000 Month of Election Years

> August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 32 years, 1988-2019 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.

> Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline.

> However, in election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve: #6 DJIA, #5 S&P 500, #1 NASDAQ (since 1971), #1 Russell 1000 and #1 Russell 2000 (since 1979). This year, the market’s performance in August will likely depend heavily on how July closes and whether or not the rate of covid-19 infection continues to accelerate which could force some areas to roll back reopenings.

*****

> # August’s First Trading Day Bearish Last 23 Years

> From the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 (page 88), it is known that the first trading days of each month combined gain nearly as much as all other days combined. However, the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2020 Almanac. In the past 23 years DJIA has risen just 30.4% (up 7, down 16) of the time on the first trading day of August. Average and median losses are on the mild side due to a few sizable advances. Over the past nine years, DJIA and S&P 500 have both declined nine times.

> Earlier today we posted a chart showing S&P 500 sector performance since the Nasdaq's recent peak on 7/20 when Technology stocks began what has now been a 10-day period of consolidation. Below we have updated these performance numbers to include today's moves. While not as many sectors remain in positive territory, the majority of sectors continue to outperform the S&P 500, while Technology drags the market lower. Along with Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary are the only other sectors that have lagged the S&P 500, and their performance has been dragged down by the mega-cap tech-like stocks of Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance.png))**

> Expanding on this theme of underlying strength in the index, the chart below shows the average performance of stocks in the S&P 500 grouped by sector. On an equal-weighted basis, the S&P 500 is actually up 1.3% since 7/20, and only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen negative average returns. On the upside, Real Estate (4.1%) has been the big winner followed by Consumer Discretionary (3.3%), and Consumer Staples (2.2%). The fact that Consumer Discretionary at the cap-weighted sector level is down over 1.4% while the average performance of stocks in the sector has been a gain of 3.3% illustrates what a mammoth impact AMZN has on that sector.

> Breadth among S&P 500 stocks has also been overwhelmingly positive. For the S&P 500 as a whole, 59% of stocks in the index have had positive returns since the close on 7/20. Only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen fewer than half of their components post positive returns over that time, while Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Utilities have seen roughly three-quarters of their components rally since 7/20.

> # Bullish Earnings Season So Far

> At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.

> In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**

> We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.

> # China Running Away YTD

> Every Wednesday, we publish our Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high-level summary of market and economic data of some of the world's largest economies. Of the 23 stock markets tracked, just six including the US are positive year to date at the moment (in local currency). In the chart below we show the YTD performance of these six countries as well as the global median in 2020. As shown, even though it was actually the first to tip into the green YTD following the global sell-off in February and March very briefly back in early June, the US is up the least of this group with a YTD gain of 0.4%. China's stock market is up the most at +14%. Taiwan, South Korea, South Africa, and Malaysia are also outperforming the US but are up more modestly than China with the best of these, Taiwan, gaining 4.53% this year. Meanwhile, the median country in our Global Macro Dashboard remains down 6.2% YTD.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-GMD-ytd.png))**

> Given it is up the most on a year to date basis, China has also gained the largest share of global equity market cap in 2020. As shown in the table below, China has gained 1.7 percentage points of global market cap in 2020 and now takes up 10.14%. China now joins the US as the only other country with a double-digit share of total world market cap. Despite this, China has actually lost share since the bear market lows on 3/23. Meanwhile, the US, Germany, Canada, India, South Korea, and Australia have all gained a significant share since 3/23.

> # Do the Top 5 Stocks Pose a Risk to the Market?

> Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. These five stocks have helped spawn a number of acronyms as they try to capture the rise of mega-cap tech stocks that have led the market higher for much of the past decade. The average return for those five stocks so far this year has been a gain of more than 30%, while the broad S&P 500 Index is just marginally positive, at 0.4% through July 30.

> While many other areas of the market have remained largely static, the total market value of these stocks has dramatically increased, making them an increasingly large piece of market cap-weighted indexes such as the S&P 500. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the combined weight of the top five stocks in the S&P 500 has increased to its highest level ever, at nearly 22%. Only one of those five stocks (Microsoft) was a top five name in the index during the previous peak of March 2000.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> But does this pose a risk to the index? From a diversification standpoint, one could certainly argue it does. For instance, if any shared risks should come up, from regulation, for example, it could do outsized damage to cap-weighted indexes. However, we believe that the recent gains have been justified by the fundamentals, and we continue to favor both large caps over small caps, and growth-style stocks over value stocks. According to analysis from Credit Suisse, over the past 12 months, the top five stocks in the index have grown revenues at 11.2% vs. just 0.8% for the rest of the S&P 500. Further, the remainder of the S&P 500 has subtracted roughly $17 from S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS), while the top five stocks have added more than $12.

> Finally, while these stocks have been the face of the recent “stay-at-home trend” and may be more insulated from broader economic weakness, they are far from the only stocks making money this year. On July 30, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index hit a new all-time high and is now up more than 15% year-to-date.

> “After a huge run, many of these top stocks may be due for a pause,” said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, looking out over the next 6 to 12 months, we believe that investors will continue to place a premium on companies that are able to organically grow sales, especially in a low-growth environment.”

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 3rd, 2020.

# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/the-jobs-report-and-congressional-politics-may-matter-more-for-markets-than-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The market could lose some of its exuberance in the week ahead as the calendar turns to August, and investors await Friday’s July employment report and keep their eyes on Washington.
*****
> The focus will also be squarely on politicians, as Congress struggles to find a middle ground on a new fiscal spending package and decide the fate of the $600 a week unemployment supplement that was set to expire July 31. Former vice president Joe Biden is also expected to name his running mate in the coming week.
*****
> The jobs data will be crucial, particularly since the number of people filing for unemployment benefits has been edging higher, instead of falling back, as expected. According to Refinitiv, about 1.36 million new jobs are expected, well below the 4.8 million added in June, and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.7% from 11.1%.
*****
> Trading around the report could be volatile, since some economists expect more than 2 million jobs were added, and some even see flat or negative payrolls.
*****
> Stocks have done well for the month of July, with the S&P 500 finishing at 3,271, a gain of 5.5%. The Nasdaq has performed the best, rising 6.8% for the month to 10,745, after a 3.7% gain for the past week.
*****
> “August has traditionally been a challenging month for investors,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The market is entering what historically has been the worst two months for stocks.
*****
> According to Stovall, the S&P 500 has been higher in August 53% of the time, and its average move is a gain of just 0.01%, going back to World War II. September is worse, down 0.51% on average, and up just 48% of the time.
*****
> In presidential election years, however the odds for August gains are better, as it rose 63% of the time and 73%, when the incumbent is up for re-election.
*****
> There are also about 120 S&P 500 companies reporting earnings, but the big earnings show for markets was this past week when four of the five biggest tech giants all reported Thursday afternoon. Three of those stocks — Apple, Amazon and Facebook — surged, helping Nasdaq outperform Friday with a more than 1.5% gain.
*****
> # Earnings scorecard
> “We’re only a month into the reporting period, and things are going to become less and less important from an earnings perspective,” said Stovall. “I think investors are sort of disappointed in that the bar was set so low for second quarter earnings that expectations were that we were going to see a lot of companies beat, which we have. But we were also going to see a gradual uplift of earnings expectations for forward quarters. We’re not seeing that.”
*****
> Eighty-two percent of the companies reporting so far have beaten estimates, well above the average 65%, according to Refinitiv. The earnings decline is now looking closer to 33% from an initial 40%, and tech, which has been leading the market is one of the best performers. Profits for the sector now look to be up 1.4%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
*****
> Because the tech names have contributed so much to market gains, their earnings were an important test for the market, and they didn’t disappoint. But they didn’t manage to pull up the whole market very far on Friday.
*****
> Among the names reporting in the coming week are a diverse group, including Disney, ViacomCBS, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Berkshire Hathaway, AIG, Clorox, and Wayfair, to name a few.
*****
> # Politics now in play
> “The earnings story is over. My call had been once we had gotten through the earnings season, we would be more vulnerable to a sustainable pullback,” said Barry Knapp, Ironside Macroeconomics managing partner and director of research. “Obviously, it’s volatility season, but it’s also an election year. ... We’re more vulnerable to that next week and earnings won’t hold us up.”
*****
> Knapp said if President Donald Trump and Republicans do not begin to perform better in the polls by Labor Day, the market is likely to focus on what a Democratic win would mean for taxes and regulation. That could be a negative for stocks.
*****
> “If he hasn’t made headway by then, it’s likely he’s done.That’s about the point when things become pretty set in stone. The market will presume that’s the case,” Knapp said.
*****
> The politics of the stimulus package could also reverberate through markets, until it looks like the Senate Republicans and House Democrats can find common ground.
*****
> The two sides look to be at a standoff, but an agreement is still expected in early August. The market is particularly watching to see what happens with the enhanced unemployment benefits. Republicans have proposed cutting it to $200, but Democrats support keeping it.
*****
> # The economy
> Cutting the size of the payments back might be good for the labor market and persuade more workers to return to work, some strategists say. However, there is also concern that the funding has helped stimulate the economy and keep the unemployed from defaulting on loans and payments. Consumer spending on goods in June was even higher than last year, and that was also seen as getting a lift from stimulus.
*****
> Besides the jobs report, there are other important data like ISM manufacturing on Monday. There are also monthly vehicle sales Monday, and ISM nonmanufacturing data Wednesday.
*****
> “I think the macro data is going to be fine next week,” said Knapp. “I’m not in the camp that thinks the payroll number is going to be negative.”
*****
> NatWest Markets economist Kevin Cummins is one of the economists who expects the jobs gains to be much smaller than the past two months. He expects the payrolls to come in at just 200,000. “You look at jobless claims, and you see a stalling out,” he said. “The Fed is right. There is significant downside risk to the economy.”
*****
> # A trade to watch
> Treasury yields, in the 2-year to 7-year range, fell to new lows in the past week. The 10-year yield, not yet at a record low, was also falling and was at 0.53% Friday. At the same time, the dollar was down more than 1% on the week and 4% for the month.
*****
> Gold was a beneficiary of the lower interest rates, weaker dollar trade, rising about 5% for the week and 10% for the month.
*****
> Strategist say investors are reacting to super-low interest rates, concerns about the economy, and the possibility that huge government spending will send inflation higher.
*****
> Investors are also jumping into inflation-protected bonds. According to Refinitiv’s Lipper, inflation-protected bond funds took in $271 million of net new money for the fund-flows week ended July 29, the sixth week of gains. About $1 billion went into the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, (GLD) in the last week, Lipper said.
*****
> During this time period, the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities funds recorded their two best weekly net inflows ever with increases of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the fund-flows weeks of June 24 and July 1.
*****
> Lipper said investors started to put money into TIPS funds in the middle of the second quarter, and the flows have been . net positive in 11 out of 13 weeks since the beginning of May. This its second-worst quarterly net outflows ever as oil prices slumped in the first quarter.
*****
> “I think this is going to be a much more inflationary decade. It will start out slowly. [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell is right that more forces are putting downward pressure on inflation at present. But the market looks past that,” said Knapp. “The big story in 2021 will be the recovery of inflation. You’re already seeing it in import prices.”

> # August: Top NASDAQ & Russell 2000 Month of Election Years

> August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 32 years, 1988-2019 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.

> Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e8afe7e1e8656f8b9beeaf3291cf8f62/02ca1964ef3531ea-f0/s400x600/77f035157f33a261b7608dc9cc36fc09a768f385.jpg))**

> However, in election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve: #6 DJIA, #5 S&P 500, #1 NASDAQ (since 1971), #1 Russell 1000 and #1 Russell 2000 (since 1979). This year, the market’s performance in August will likely depend heavily on how July closes and whether or not the rate of covid-19 infection continues to accelerate which could force some areas to roll back reopenings.

*****

> # August’s First Trading Day Bearish Last 23 Years

> From the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 (page 88), it is known that the first trading days of each month combined gain nearly as much as all other days combined. However, the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2020 Almanac. In the past 23 years DJIA has risen just 30.4% (up 7, down 16) of the time on the first trading day of August. Average and median losses are on the mild side due to a few sizable advances. Over the past nine years, DJIA and S&P 500 have both declined nine times.

> # S&P 500 Stronger Underneath the Surface

> Earlier today we posted a chart showing S&P 500 sector performance since the Nasdaq's recent peak on 7/20 when Technology stocks began what has now been a 10-day period of consolidation. Below we have updated these performance numbers to include today's moves. While not as many sectors remain in positive territory, the majority of sectors continue to outperform the S&P 500, while Technology drags the market lower. Along with Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary are the only other sectors that have lagged the S&P 500, and their performance has been dragged down by the mega-cap tech-like stocks of Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance.png))**

> Expanding on this theme of underlying strength in the index, the chart below shows the average performance of stocks in the S&P 500 grouped by sector. On an equal-weighted basis, the S&P 500 is actually up 1.3% since 7/20, and only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen negative average returns. On the upside, Real Estate (4.1%) has been the big winner followed by Consumer Discretionary (3.3%), and Consumer Staples (2.2%). The fact that Consumer Discretionary at the cap-weighted sector level is down over 1.4% while the average performance of stocks in the sector has been a gain of 3.3% illustrates what a mammoth impact AMZN has on that sector.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Avg.png))**

> Breadth among S&P 500 stocks has also been overwhelmingly positive. For the S&P 500 as a whole, 59% of stocks in the index have had positive returns since the close on 7/20. Only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen fewer than half of their components post positive returns over that time, while Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Utilities have seen roughly three-quarters of their components rally since 7/20.

> # Bullish Earnings Season So Far

> At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.

> In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**

> We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.

> # China Running Away YTD

> Every Wednesday, we publish our Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high-level summary of market and economic data of some of the world's largest economies. Of the 23 stock markets tracked, just six including the US are positive year to date at the moment (in local currency). In the chart below we show the YTD performance of these six countries as well as the global median in 2020. As shown, even though it was actually the first to tip into the green YTD following the global sell-off in February and March very briefly back in early June, the US is up the least of this group with a YTD gain of 0.4%. China's stock market is up the most at +14%. Taiwan, South Korea, South Africa, and Malaysia are also outperforming the US but are up more modestly than China with the best of these, Taiwan, gaining 4.53% this year. Meanwhile, the median country in our Global Macro Dashboard remains down 6.2% YTD.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-GMD-ytd.png))**

> Given it is up the most on a year to date basis, China has also gained the largest share of global equity market cap in 2020. As shown in the table below, China has gained 1.7 percentage points of global market cap in 2020 and now takes up 10.14%. China now joins the US as the only other country with a double-digit share of total world market cap. Despite this, China has actually lost share since the bear market lows on 3/23. Meanwhile, the US, Germany, Canada, India, South Korea, and Australia have all gained a significant share since 3/23.

> # Do the Top 5 Stocks Pose a Risk to the Market?

> Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. These five stocks have helped spawn a number of acronyms as they try to capture the rise of mega-cap tech stocks that have led the market higher for much of the past decade. The average return for those five stocks so far this year has been a gain of more than 30%, while the broad S&P 500 Index is just marginally positive, at 0.4% through July 30.

> While many other areas of the market have remained largely static, the total market value of these stocks has dramatically increased, making them an increasingly large piece of market cap-weighted indexes such as the S&P 500. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the combined weight of the top five stocks in the S&P 500 has increased to its highest level ever, at nearly 22%. Only one of those five stocks (Microsoft) was a top five name in the index during the previous peak of March 2000.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> But does this pose a risk to the index? From a diversification standpoint, one could certainly argue it does. For instance, if any shared risks should come up, from regulation, for example, it could do outsized damage to cap-weighted indexes. However, we believe that the recent gains have been justified by the fundamentals, and we continue to favor both large caps over small caps, and growth-style stocks over value stocks. According to analysis from Credit Suisse, over the past 12 months, the top five stocks in the index have grown revenues at 11.2% vs. just 0.8% for the rest of the S&P 500. Further, the remainder of the S&P 500 has subtracted roughly $17 from S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS), while the top five stocks have added more than $12.

> Finally, while these stocks have been the face of the recent “stay-at-home trend” and may be more insulated from broader economic weakness, they are far from the only stocks making money this year. On July 30, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index hit a new all-time high and is now up more than 15% year-to-date.

> “After a huge run, many of these top stocks may be due for a pause,” said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, looking out over the next 6 to 12 months, we believe that investors will continue to place a premium on companies that are able to organically grow sales, especially in a low-growth environment.”

**RBC**: ""While we believe Roku’s Ad platform is facing headwinds due to its considerable exposure to Brand advertising spend and its reliance on verticals like Casual Dining, Travel & Tourism, we are struck by the fact that ROKU just printed approx. 50% Y/Y Ad Revenue growth in (hopefully) the most COVID-impacted quarter. That will almost certainly be the strongest Q2 growth among the ‘Net Ad Platforms, in our view. Roku is benefitting from the Small Numbers Law, but it is also fully exposed to arguably the fastest growing Ad Vertical today – OTT/CTV. The market was displeased with ROKU’s lack of Q3 commentary, but the company did specifically state that one its most important Ad Revenue drivers – Active Users – was growing strongly QTD. We also view the decision to retain “Seattle” Steve Louden as CFO as a positive sign. ROKU remains one of our Top SMID Cap Longs.""

**DA Davidson**: ""Consider company's announcement that CFO Steve Louden was not leaving Roku as the most significant one for the quarter, as we hold him in high esteem...Despite MAGNA's expectation of U.S. digital advertising is expected to decline 5% Y/Y, Roku posted impressive growth, while operating a historically cyclical business model through the pandemic. Monetized video ad impressions grew approximately 50% in the second quarter, as Roku continues to see the benefits of its in-house DSP, dataxu. While the company did not provide any cadence of sales trends in the second quarter or July, we suspect, based on other companies that have reported (Pinterest and Quotient Technology) that monthly sequential advertising demand is increasing, with more advertisers “turning back on” ad impressions.""

**Needham**: ""Roku's most important upside value driver in 2Q (our view) was its ecosytem growth at 3.2mm new adds, reaching 43mm Active Accounts (ie, 50% of US Connected TV homes) at 6/30/20. Plus Roku sold an additional 3mm sticks to existing Roku homes which raises LTV because more ads are viewable on additional TVs inside a home. We also liked ROKU's revenue stream diversification in 2Q20, especially its doubling q/q of recurring revenue from SVOD sign ups and TVOD revenue. Risk falls as revenue diversification rises, and/or revs become more predictable. We raise our estimates and PT based on valuation multiple upside as Roku's revenue mix becomes more predictable and diversifies.""

**Oppenheimer**: ""We increase our PT to $185 (was $140) and maintain our Outperform as 2Q results topped Street expectations on better than anticipated Platform results and comp valuations have expanded. Platform revenue/gross profit exceeded Street by 11%/12%, with platform revenue +31%E Ex. dataxu on stronger video ad sales, with new clients +40% y/y. While management isn't providing guidance, it sees strong July player sales, and highlighted returning sports as a catalyst for VMPD subscription revenue to rebound. Easier 3Q licensing revenue comps and expanding relationship with key OEM partner TCL to international markets should reduce investor concerns. Full launch and adoption of OneView Ad Platform could prove upside to 4Q/2021.""

**The bears**:

**Morgan Stanley**: ""2Q results were broadly in-line, with strong consumer adoption driving account growth and player sales, but a sequential deceleration in Platform revenue growth due to the broader advertising environment. A premium valuation, rising ecosystem tensions, and below consensus '21 estimates leave us UW.""

**Pivotal**: ""ROKU beat our 2Q expectations (which were published May 7th and did not factor in the clear improvement in the pace of advertising declines in June + the massive NFLX (BUY) subscriber beat). ROKU reasonably did not provide any guidance for the balance of ’20 given uncertainty in the advertising environment but talked about relatively “exceptional” advertising results. During 2Q, ROKU management intelligently took advantage of the clearly rich valuation as they disclosed, an effective $350M equity secondary offering at the market price at the time. ROKU also re-stated its streaming hours downward materially based on a mismeasurement that it said it has corrected.""",2020-08-06
i5k3nd,54,46,wallstreetbets,$WORK - Earnings Play 09/02 (9.5k YOLO - 31.5c 09/11),0.83,1596856582.0,1596827782.0,"I want to first preface this by saying that this is an unconventional DD - read at your own risk. I will not be going into TA nor FA to justify why $WORK is the next big play.

**Recap & Highlights:**

\- $WORK reports its earnings on 09/02

\- $WORK is currently trading between $29-$30

\- $WORK beat its earnings expectations last quarter (Actual -0.02 vs Expected -0.06)

\- After $WORK reported earnings, its share price plummeted down to \~$32

\- $WORK is expected to report -0.03 EPS for the upcoming quarter

**Due Diligence:**

\- The hype hasn't yet started. And once it starts, it’ll explode. Hype is the only reason why $WORK was trading near $40 pre-ER 2 months ago. Hype is the reason why $TSLA saw 70% capital appreciation in 3 weeks. Hype is the reason why PRPL - sorry. I guess it’s too soon for you sad fucking sheeptards, I’ll stop right here.

[No recent $WORK posts](https://preview.redd.it/5zju44ez9nf51.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=564ce74cad64c7fd16a5c0bc57662189cd0c64ee)

\- Other dogshit, popular tech companies like $DBX, $PD, $SNAP, $CRM, $WDAY, $SPLK, $ATVI, $ROKU and $DDOG all had their run ups to new ATH pre-ER despite their shitty/decent performances from last quarter, so why not $WORK?

That's it. That’s my entire rendition.

It's a shit stock, but people will still hype it up because it's tech and it's popular. The hyped up buying power could kick in as early as next week, but it will surely kick in within a few weeks time. Don’t you want to get in on the train early before it takes off like PRPL, $SLV and $NKLA? Then just buy your September calls right now. Who cares if you lose time-value when the increase in IV due to the earnings hype can compensate for it? $WORK was one of the most hyped up tech stocks before last ER. Just close the position out right before it. It’s trading near \~$29 without any hype whatsoever. Perfect entry.

**Proof of 9.5k yolo:**

**TLDR:**

Will it beat earnings? - Who cares?

How does it compare with its competitors? - Equally shitty if not shittier.

Is the company profitable? - Not yet, and the future outlook looks grim when it's still going under during an all WFH-age.

What do you think about the stock? - It's shit. There are better options.

But will it have a run-up and hype? - Absolutely. Just close before ER.

Don’t follow the hype. Create it.

Remember when Trump said that america is seeing high number of cases because they are testing too much, yeah right. He found a way to fix this. Just be careful when you FOMO into IVR, AAL, cuz this shit has definitely not peaked. Tho a lot of retard are being played right now, stick with quality and SLV of course :D

i8iyvj,55,22,stocks,GOOG vs AAPL? Which do you prefer longterm?,0.88,1597285041.0,1597256241.0,"Been thinking of whether I should trim my apple or google positions and honestly...feeling kinda bearish on Google.

Google has been lagging QQQ for a while now. I guess partly due to the ad cutting due to corona. But it also seems like their ad revenue growth has been decelerating for other reasons with a lot of players attacking the space from different angles (Amzn,TTD, Roku, FB, ramp etc).

 Their company culture is heavily based around engineering yet not so savvy when it comes to product marketing and expanding shareholder value. They come up with cool tech but seem to always be either too late or too early to the party. Google glasses didn't pan out, pixel phones are a modest success but not taking the industry by storm, google shopping is a money sink, Google fiber was curtailed, Fitbit acquisition is kind of iffy (Samsung/Garmin/Apple already dominate the space across respective demographics). They keep selling the AI future but Waymo seems to be the only thing they have going here that can turn out to be truly profitable. Will that be enough though?

Apple on the other hand knows how to drive share price. Always doing buybacks. Although they are historically a hardware focused company they are transitioning more and more into the services industry with their popular app store, Apple TV+, apple pay etc. Seems like this will be their long-term pivot. And road ahead seems more clearer to me than Google's. 


Seems like AAPL just has more growth opportunities left in it and has superior company culture. Google seems to be transitioning to more of a value stock. What are your thoughts?",2020-08-12

It's currently sitting at the low end of its monthly range. I'm getting in now with October 180c before the analysts start upgrading this bad boy.

As of this writing, it is at $147.5. There is not a single day in the last month that ROKU has not traded at $150 or higher, including earlier this morning. This is a steal. What do you think?

iin99v,27,40,wallstreetbets,My best ideas: CHWY and CWH,0.94,1598708782.0,1598679982.0,"I thought I'd give you guys a two-fer since the tickers are almost the same.

CHWY is going to have a great quarter to report in two weeks. Most of the other online retailers did, and anecdotes say that the pet segment will grow faster than most. Moreover, CHWY hasn't really rocketed like a lot of other tech stocks. I have 10/16 $60c, and I'm going to throw in some septembers closer to the earnings date on September 10th. CHWY just broke resistance today to trade over $60 for the first time and I think it has further to run.

The other best idea I have is CWH. It dropped a bit after a great earnings report because it had a strong runup to $40. Then a major shareholder sold some shares and the stock plummeted down under $30. The stock seems to have found a bottom and is on the way back up, currently around $31.5.

The CEO has been [buying millions of dollars worth of stock](https://theheadlinereporter.com/lemonis-buys-again/) with his own hard earned cash. He's holding a virtual investor's conference on 9/15. I think price moves to $35 or back to $40 are imminent. I have October $30 calls, but you don't have to be that conservative.

So far it's worked out so well that all those zeroes are no longer impressive.

Until things go to shit, I guess.

So I've sold a lot of my TSLA (which is enough to buy a small apartment, so not fuck you money but not nothing).

itjbrt,29,18,stocks,Peloton thinks it can grow to 100 million subscribers. Here's how,0.83,1600238190.0,1600209390.0,"Peloton just had a breakout quarter, as sales of its high-tech bikes skyrocketed, and its subscriber base surged at a triple-digit rate, with more people than ever working out at home. 

And at a time when many other businesses are using the uncertainty brought by the coronavirus pandemic to yank financial forecasts, Peloton is raising the bar for itself. CEO John Foley said the fitness company is aiming to have 100 million paying subscribers. 


""100 million subscribers, we believe is a reasonable goal,"" Foley said Tuesday during Peloton's first investor meeting as a public company, which was held virtually. ""There's close to 200 million gym-goers in the world. That's 200 million people paying hard money, month after month, to access what we believe to be inferior fitness equipment in an inferior location."" 

Peloton ended its latest quarter with more than 1.09 million connected fitness subscribers, up 113% from a year earlier, and roughly 3.1 million members in total, including those who only pay for its digital subscription. 

Connected fitness subscribers are people who pay $39 per month to sync workout classes to their Peloton equipment, versus accessing the programs separately through a phone or tablet and paying just $12.99. 

Here are the six things Foley said will get the company to 100 million subscribers: 

Core U.S. growth

Peloton is looking to grow much larger on its home turf. In the U.S., Foley said, there are 35 million households with a treadmill, ""and they're not used because they're just pieces of hardware and they're not fun."" He said he believes tens of millions of homes in the U.S. could be Peloton customers in the coming years. 


Product innovation

Peloton just earlier this month launched a higher-priced Bike+, which includes a rotating screen for floor workouts and connects with an Apple Watch, among a number of other features. But Foley said there are many more product announcements to come. ""Please trust me when I say we have a lot more innovation ... a lot more cool stuff,"" the CEO said Tuesday. 

Geographic expansion

Peloton is currently in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Germany. But it is looking to launch in additional geographies in the coming years, also adding instructors who will teach classes in new languages. 

Greater affordability

Peloton also wants to make its high-tech bikes and treadmills more accessible and affordable to a wider audience. It knows its equipment is expensive: Its new Bike+ retails for $2,495, while the original Peloton bike's price is $1,895. Peloton's pricier and original treadmill, the Tread+, retails for $4,295. The less-expensive Tread, which is not yet available for sale, is set to retail for $2,495 at its debut. 

Foley said Peloton is looking at renting out bikes and also selling used bikes in the future, as two ways the company can lower the cost of a Peloton to potential customers. 

Digital expansion

In the past 12 months, Peloton has made its app and fitness content accessible via Roku TV, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and Android TV. Foley said the company is looking to expand further with other tech giants. And it is also rolling out more of original content online, also growing its music library and partnering with major artists. 

Create the best place to work in the world

""We want to be the best employer and the best place to work,"" Foley said. ""This is a massive, massive global opportunity. I don't think many people really understand how big this opportunity is."" 

Peloton shares were climbing more than 5% Tuesday afternoon, having risen more than 200% this year. The company has a market cap of $24.9 billion. On Sept. 10, the stock hit an all-time-high of $98.61.

Stocks continued sinking Monday, with the three major indexes extending last week’s declines. The drop continued as traders became concerned with stagnating improvement in coronavirus cases and political uncertainty, with the US presidential election around 6 weeks out. The Dow fell the hardest today, finishing 1.84% down, the Nasdaq finished 0.39% up, and the SPY was 1.07% down.

Nicholas Colas, Co-founder of DataTrek Research said, “The root causes of the recent drawdown in US large caps are \[first\], recent weakness in real-time economic indicators, \[second\] the lack of movement on a fiscal stimulus package that could offset #1 and \[third\] the Fed’s lackluster forecasts in its Wednesday release of the Summary of Economic Projections”.

Shares of major bank stocks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), HSBC (HSBC) and Deutsche Bank (DB) fell following a report that they and other financial institutions for decades facilitated fund transactions used for allegedly criminal activities, and failed to report suspicious activity. The report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists found five global banks moved ""staggering sums of illicit cash for shadowy characters and criminal networks that have spread chaos and undermined democracy around the world."" The report cited documents leaked by BuzzFeed News that identified more than $2 trillion in transactions between 1999 and 2017 that were flagged by financial institutions’ internal compliance officers as possible money laundering or other criminal activity, including $514 billion at JPMorgan and $1.3 trillion at Deutsche Bank.

“Reopening stocks”, or stocks benefits when the economy looks like it will reopen soon amid the pandemic, fell steeply today, as fear over coronavirus cases here and abroad led to fear of more business closure. In the US, there are now, sadly, 200,000 deaths and new cases have risen in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, and North Dakota, per Yahoo Finance. WHO officials warned that the spread of coronavirus in Europe now is worse than it was in March, near the start of the pandemic and that a ‘very serious situation is unfolding in Europe”.

**FIRST A NOTE ON DIVIDENDS:** I wanted to go through all stocks with dividends and assume reinvestment of dividends to be included in performance. What happened? Well, I didn't do that. It was taking far too long and work/school has been crushing me... no excuses. I should've done it and I didn't. So for stocks with a dividend that has come out in the last 3 months, the results won't be accurate. For that I apologize.


**TIME FRAME: 6/22 - 9/22**

* VTI: +6.7%

* QQQ: +10.4%

* SPY: +6.3%

* DIA: +4.8%


**SOME TAKE AWAYS FROM THE DATA**

* First and foremost, 6/22 - 9/22 is only a 3 month period during a very strange year in the stock market, so any conclusions should be taken with a heavy dose of salt.

* Average participant performance was 13.65%, outperforming the indices by a solid margin. That's fantastic! 

* If you have a couple of solid winners, it doesn't matter if you have some bad losers. Many participants did very well because one of their picks outperformed significantly.

* In this crazy bull market, valuation seems meaningless (unless you're AYX, a company with incredible growth that slowed considerably during the pandemic, and subsequently took a BIG haircut)

* Holding through turbulence is paramount for long term investors. TSLA had some crazy swings from 6/22 - 9/22, but is still up 113% over that time period.

* Of the 47 participants, only 7 had negative performance, indicating that we are still in a strong bull market. 

* Of the 47 participants, 31 outperformed SPY. This validates my belief that stock picking CAN WORK, if one is willing to do the work to have high conviction, and can hold long term through volatility.

* Over this time period, FAANG was up an average of 10.4%, EXACTLY mirroring the performance of QQQ.

**1st place by a long shot: u/Ataraxuh, up 68.82% from 6/22 - 9/22**

* Best performer: NIO, up 158.82%

* Worst performer: TGT, up 25.85%

**2nd place: u/kex06, up 50.58% from 6/22 - 9/22**

* Best performer: NIO, up 158.82%

* Worst performer: NKLA, -59.27%

*Even though NKLA performed terribly, u/kex06 is still in 2nd place due to picking a couple of big winners*

**3rd place: u/thejmils, up 48.85% from 6/22 - 9/22**

* Best performer: NAIL, up 87.43% (leveraged home builders ETF)

* Worst performer: SOXL, up 25.54% (leveraged semiconductor ETF)

j3ghtd,30,341,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, Oct 1. Please enjoy!",0.98,1601612583.0,1601583783.0," **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 1, 2020**

Stocks jumped higher in the first session of October before losing strength throughout the session, buoyed by hope that lawmakers will provide more stimulus before the November election and slightly better than expected unemployment numbers. 

The three major indices closed out the month of September red, falling an average of 4% for the first monthly loss since March. The major benchmarks posted their worst September performance since 2011, according to Yahoo Finance. But zooming out to include trading from July and August, equities’ third-quarter performance held up much more strongly. The S&P 500 posted its best third-quarter advance since 2010 with a rise of 8.5%, per Bloomberg.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) ended the day 1.59% up, the S&P (SPY) finished 0.62% up, and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.22% in another volatile session.

It seems traders are expecting September’s volatility to carry into October, with political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election at the top of their mind, especially after the, shall we say, contentious debate. Hopes for additional, much-needed stimulus dimmed after in-person talks between Pelosi, Mnuchin, and Congressional lawmakers did not produce an agreement. While the pair said they made progress and had further discussions planned, many are skeptical any kind of deal will be reached before the election in November.

For the many, the economic situation at the hands of the pandemic remains dire, with a slew of job cuts being announced. Airlines American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are moving forward with a collective 32,000 job cuts after contingencies tied to federal coronavirus relief aid they received earlier this year expired on Wednesday. Disney (DIS) said it would be cutting 28,000 workers across its resort business. Insurance giant Allstate (ALL) announced an 8% reduction in its workforce, impacting some 3,800 jobs. Goldman Sachs (GS) is also reportedly looking to cut about 400 jobs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, and the oil major Shell (RDS) announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs.

The labor report released this week will not capture these planned layoffs, those will most likely be reflected in next weeks’ report. The Labor Department reported that another 837,000 people filed for first-time unemployment insurance. While this is below the 850,000 estimate and an improvement on last week's number, it is clear that the labor market is still struggling during the pandemic and needs Congressional assistance to get back on track.  Tomorrow September’s monthly jobs report will be released. Analysts expect a fifth straight month of payroll gains and 868,000 jobs to have come back. However, after the announcement of massive job cuts this week, we’ll have to see if analysts revise their estimates.

* US manufacturing activity unexpectedly decelerated in September, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) monthly manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI). The index ticked down to 55.4 in September from 56.0 in August, whereas consensus economists expected a rise to 56.5. 
* The Senate Commerce Committee voted to authorize subpoenas forcing testimony from Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet (GOOG) setting up what could be a contentious hearing with the largest U.S. social-media companies in the midst of a national election.

Stocks jumped higher in the first session of October before losing strength throughout the session, buoyed by hope that lawmakers will provide more stimulus before the November election and slightly better than expected unemployment numbers. 

The three major indices closed out the month of September red, falling an average of 4% for the first monthly loss since March. The major benchmarks posted their worst September performance since 2011, according to Yahoo Finance. But zooming out to include trading from July and August, equities’ third-quarter performance held up much more strongly. The S&P 500 posted its best third-quarter advance since 2010 with a rise of 8.5%, per Bloomberg.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) ended the day 1.59% up, the S&P (SPY) finished 0.62% up, and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.22% in another volatile session.

It seems traders are expecting September’s volatility to carry into October, with political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election at the top of their mind, especially after the, shall we say, contentious debate. Hopes for additional, much-needed stimulus dimmed after in-person talks between Pelosi, Mnuchin, and Congressional lawmakers did not produce an agreement. While the pair said they made progress and had further discussions planned, many are skeptical any kind of deal will be reached before the election in November.

For the many, the economic situation at the hands of the pandemic remains dire, with a slew of job cuts being announced. Airlines American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are moving forward with a collective 32,000 job cuts after contingencies tied to federal coronavirus relief aid they received earlier this year expired on Wednesday. Disney (DIS) said it would be cutting 28,000 workers across its resort business. Insurance giant Allstate (ALL) announced an 8% reduction in its workforce, impacting some 3,800 jobs. Goldman Sachs (GS) is also reportedly looking to cut about 400 jobs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, and the oil major Shell (RDS) announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs.

The labor report released this week will not capture these planned layoffs, those will most likely be reflected in next weeks’ report. The Labor Department reported that another 837,000 people filed for first-time unemployment insurance. While this is below the 850,000 estimate and an improvement on last week's number, it is clear that the labor market is still struggling during the pandemic and needs Congressional assistance to get back on track.  Tomorrow September’s monthly jobs report will be released. Analysts expect a fifth straight month of payroll gains and 868,000 jobs to have come back. However, after the announcement of massive job cuts this week, we’ll have to see if analysts revise their estimates.

This industry has a lack of transparency so I'm more than happy to say I will provide lots of that throughout this post with screenshots. There are LOTS of imgur links to back what I say so it's not just words on a post expecting you to just believe what I'm typing.

This post I suppose is ""Part 2"" my post back in April, [""After 2 years of Daytrading. 7 months full time. Here's my advice""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/fw82ow/after_2_years_of_daytrading_7_months_full_time/). I'm doing this to update everyone who came/comes across this in the future. Yes, it is possible. No, it won't be easy. You will pay homage to the rite of passage into this career. I'll also provide some examples of styles of trading so for the newer aspiring traders, there will be some things I rarely see discussed on forums. So here's to 1 year of [Full Time Day Trading](https://imgur.com/a/wG4UQBO)

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- You'll become desensitized to trading. Stubborn to other strategies (There are bigger/badder/more lucrative strategies. Don't chase them. Why fix what's not broken? I know what works for me and I'm content with it. No strategy is better than another. It's a personal choice. ). Losing individual trades won't faze you, they're inevitable. Profiting certainly feels better. After a while, you won't be as enthralled to trade every morning, it'll become just another part of your day). Trading is just managing your money through a statistic and the medium to execute it is trading on your platform. **Think: ""If. Then. Because"".** Your trading plan should be that black and white. **Ask ""Why"" for everything you do and use. If you can't answer it with documented results, drop it.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

~~I get a bunch of messages all the time from people asking -~~ . [Out of those who follow](https://imgur.com/a/W58BFbe) me and [chat me seeking further tips](https://imgur.com/a/3DUYbwg) through my previous posts. I'll be answering the FAQ's and addressing things I see frequently in this sub as far as trading axioms

**Disclaimer**: I won't sugarcoat anything. I'll share my experiences and add pieces of advice I'd give to those who are currently experiencing the same thing becoming a full time day trader and what day to day life is like, the occasional distress, (*DRAWDOWNS*). Some of you follow my Twitter for the past few months where I post my daily watchlists with a snippet that reveals my DayTradingBuyingPower. I do this not to brag but to demonstrate that the account does yield growth, I pay myself, and there are days where the balance does not move because there was no edge. I also do this since nobody else shows their account performance. (Yes. You, Mr. YouTube gurus and wannabe gurus).

We do this for income, the numbers on our accounts are real. Treat it as such. Get your initial capital out of your account THEN try to ""*Scale your account*"" with your profits **AKA The Market's Money.**

&#x200B;

**I'll go over:**

•FAQ's that I get in my inbox *(I'm still welcome to further questions if I don't answer here)*

•Decision Fatigue *(You will experience this)*

•The previous year (2019-2020) of ups and downs

•How to use my watchlists that I post on Twitter in the morning to your advantage

•The pivotal moment that changed my trading career *(NFLX 10-17-19)*

•The road to becoming a full time trader. *(It won't be fun unless you're handed the money)*

•You'll have a better grasp of my strategy (Between ProTip 4 and 5. ProTip 8.)

&#x200B;

**There are 10 ""ProTips"" throughout the post that I wish I could tell myself years back** and I'll periodically throw them in here as the post goes on. I make posts long in order to segregate those serious about this business and those who will just become another statistic in the failure rate of this business.

&#x200B;

**At the end of this post, I'll go over the frequent questions I receive such as**: (Answers to FAQ at bottom of post.)

1. ""How do you prepare for a trading day?""
2. ""What would you go back to tell yourself?""
3. ""Books?"" (*The most abused question, but I get it. I could start a public library with just trading books I bought over the years*)
4. ""What is your background?""
5. ""What is a normal day for you?""
6. ""How did you discover your strategy?""
7. ""What did you do/How did you get started?""
8. ""What is your % return?"" (Not a fun question since a trading account is not an index or investment account. Intraday traders do not measure performance in %. Most are measured in ""R"".)
9. ""Is <insert sum of money here> enough to start trading?""
10. ""Why do you need so many monitors""? (This one is rarely asked but I do see it discussed on platforms and people trading on mobile phones love giving flack to anybody who trades on multiple monitors. Hint: Everyone's different. Whatever works for the individual. **There are no rules in trading. The only rule is that it works**.)

&#x200B;

# My story:

**Background:**

I heard about daytrading during the **2008** crash while in high school. We all want to make more while working less. I entertained day trading from time to time but always realized I never had enough money. Horrible mindset because I could have still researched WHILE saving money to put into my trading business.

**2015 -** [I opened my first trading account with Scottrade](https://imgur.com/a/Vxcq07g) while in the Marines. Apparently if you have a net worth of over $1,000,000 you can get out early (Biggest rumor ever).

I frivolously bought crap penny stocks. In short - I was a hair away from gambling. What made it NOT gambling was the fact that at least I owned something tangible (Securities of a company) and anything can happen. Buy low sell high was my strategy. Didn't work obviously. No idea what I was doing. I'd buy and hold hoping to wake up to the stock price being way higher and it never happened.

&#x200B;

•**ProTip #1** : *If you hold a trade overnight... It is not daytrading. Stop turning into an investor because you can't admit a minor defeat.*

&#x200B;

**2017 -** I started taking this business seriously while working in the oilfield as a Logistics Planner (If you're wondering what company since I am asked this from time to time, Google: ""World's largest oilfield services company"").

No kids, girlfriend/wife or financial obligations. I worked 10AM - 7PM CST and would trade the open from home for roughly 1 hour. Later I was offered to be a Data Analyst... Only downside was... I couldn't trade since I had to be at work now at 8AM CST during the market open. In the moment of signing the offer letter, I was bummed thinking, ""No more trading,""

That wasn't the case though. You can still build your trading business with a 9-5 and while never making one trade. The data is there.

&#x200B;

•**ProTip #2 :** *We all see the same data. It's there forever. Many strategies show their edge both live and in hindsight the same. (Especially if you trade patterns). You CAN build your business as a trader without even taking a trade. You CAN build your strategy while working a 9-5. Just because you're not trading, does not mean you can't build your business through research. You won't know how you'll react to the losses but at least you can diagnose the raw data with a large enough sample size for assurance and confidence.*

&#x200B;

If you have a 9-5 and want to go fulltime into this business. Stay for a bit, save, live so far beneath your means that it is *almost* miserable, (depending on your expenses, area you live, family etc) and get a few hundred sample sizes of your strategy! And for your PTO/days off... trade the open. I sacrificed my vacation days to trade.

After **2** years in corporate America, eating cheap food, never going out, saving relentlessly, I made the decision to just do it and resigned. I went straight into the ring of fire known as trading. That was on: **September 23rd, 2019**

*""<insert a bunch of negative comments from family and friends of how bad of an idea it is to go resign from an easy 9-5.>""* ^((Sound familiar?))

&#x200B;

**When you hear these types of comments.. your response should be**: *""Nobody put the time I put into this. The 90%+ who fail, don't have it all written out, computerized backtests, manual backtests, statistics, SOP manuals, JUST like the job I have which is a business, I'm just another cog in their wheel. I'll just be wearing all the hats in my trading business. Instead of Oil&Gas, it's just for trading""*. One thing I see here a lot is people saying to trade X amount of months/years or make X.

&#x200B;

•**ProTip #3 -** *Think in man hours, not calendar. Example:*

**Trader A** puts in 1 hour of study/work/research everyday for 1 year. (**365** Hours)

**Trader B** puts in 12 hours of work **every day** for 4 months. (\~**1,450** Hours)

**Trader A** lives in a major city while **Trader B** lives in the middle of nowhere. (Think cost of living)

2 totally different living expenses and 2 different calibers of dedication. I'd put my money on **Trader B** because he put in more man hours. (**\~1,000 more hours** on the clock to be more exact).

&#x200B;

**ProTip #4** \- *Have a cushion in your account AND your personal bank account. Having a strategy is great but you won't know entirely if you can fulfill and execute your plan until you experience the ups and downs both short and long term. A strategy is constant over long periods of time... there will be days, weeks, and perhaps a month here and there where you aren't making much money. We hear all the time, ""Trade like a casino"". Casinos don't make money day after day but the odds are in there favor over the long haul.*

&#x200B;

**Month 1 of full time trading was great:**

Immediately after going full time, the first month **(September 2019 to October 2019**), I did super well. Business as usual. No stress. Everything going as planned. No turbulence. At least not like I had ever experienced...

&#x200B;

**The 2 prerequisites I had before resigning was:**

1. Show consistency in returns. Consistent Sharpe Ratio.
2. [Make a 4 figure trade](https://imgur.com/a/4O35MR2) (I achieved this while short 100 shares on ROKU September 20th, 2019 and even made a victory post if you scroll down my profile's posts.)

&#x200B;

**First life-changing trading lesson learned as a full time trader:**

That money printing spree ended on **NFLX October 17th, 2019**. Less than 1 month of being a full time trader. Deviating and going against my plan I actually made [$500 in a matter of 4 minutes](https://imgur.com/a/uLB7hsx). If you follow my watchlists on Twitter, **I always trade with the direction of the gap**. If I notate, ""Long Watches"" that means I will only trade it IF (and only IF) I see a long biased pattern. Likewise I will only be looking to short my ""Short Watches"". Plenty of times I'll call out a ticker and it immediately goes the other way. No harm no foul because there was no long biased pattern to confirm my thesis.

On 10-17-2019, [I went against my plan and it worked..](https://imgur.com/a/OcC8AV7) NFLX gapped up to resistance and I went short when it tanked off of a short pattern.[(This is known as fading)](https://imgur.com/a/9i2cdmi). The market gave me a free lunch and then some. So now I'm walking on air in my mind:

*""I'm an absolute unit""*

*""I'll do it again and clear another $500 to make it a 4 figure day before 9:30AM Central""*

*""Should have quit my job way earlier being this good.""*

Within 30 minutes of the open. I gave all $500 back. Yes I wanted to trade it back. Never have I had the desire to smash anything but I do understand those who do! Yes I stood there and felt like each passing second was wasted opportunity. **The next 24 hours were long!**

&#x200B;

**ProTip #5:** *It's circumstances like that that help you in the long run. FunFact: I never once deviated from my plan since. Not ever again.*

&#x200B;

""I could have paid for my groceries and electric for the month after 4 minutes of trading if I just took the free pass the market gave me"" I felt dumb but in hindsight, I'm glad at what happened. It was this exact instance that married me to my strategy/business plan. The next day and the **7** trading days following. I didn't make 1 profiting trade. My longest ever drawdown - **11 straight trades.** While researching I found out this was **Decision Fatigue** (I'll go over this shortly below)

&#x200B;

**Put yourself in that situation...**

You have bills and your income is strictly trading. I don't care how much a robot you think you are or how strongly you believe in probabilities, when you were in an office less than a month ago making almost 6 figures sitting in an air conditioned office knowing direct deposit is on its way every other Friday no matter how well or poorly you performed at work.. Now you're in the hot seat. Its a bottomless feeling. Now all of your friends and families words are ringing in your head.

But just like a boxing match.. you gotta take a hit to get a hit. Win some, lose some, shake hands and get back to normal life. Water under the bridge.

Mind you:

•No guaranteed direct deposit every 2 weeks.

•No more medical/dental insurance.

•401K retirement is no longer being matched.

&#x200B;

11 trades is nothing. You only require \~5.5 trades at 2:1RRR to make it back OR 3.5 trades at 3:1RRR. It's nothing especially in your research because [you can easily just scroll a little more and see, ""Oh that's just a drawdown. No big deal"".](https://imgur.com/a/2CYrFhP) How will you react in real time? Will you buckle or choke? But the thing is, I was skipping trades out of fear and JUST so happened to be picking all of the unsuccessful ones. *(Decision Fatigue)*

Think about those 2 weeks of being in a drawdown. Half of the month. You're not just stagnant, your account is bleeding slowly but surely. Next time you're looking at your spreadsheet/backtest/predictive model/research.. try to put yourself in those days of drawdown. **It's not just 11 boxes of red with ""-1R"" or ""Loss"" in them**. The screenshot above on Imgur is just a recent example.

Think about your daily routine, going to the gym, hanging with friends, grocery shopping, cooking, going to bed, waking up, doing a routine, then losing again.. and again.. and again. **Try to think of life during those 300+ hours (Weekends too) of, ""I haven't made money. I've lost money. And I still have bills. After paying them, I'll be closer to my set Risk of Ruin"".**

Here's a lesson you won't learn before going fulltime but I'll do my best to emphasize it here:

Pick a strategy. And stick with it. It can literally be anything. Don't spread yourself thin watching 20+ tickers and be a jack of all patterns/tickers. **Be a master of 1 pattern and master of 1 circumstance.** There's this real thing called [""Decision Fatigue""](https://imgur.com/a/MhWncCz) which explains exactly why what happened.. happened. The article explains that the 2 outcomes of this mental strain known as **""Decision Fatigue""** is:

1. **Risky Decision-Making**
2. **Decision Avoidance**

Sound familiar? Does it kind of make sense now? As a new trader you have YouTube, Facebook, StockTwits, Twitter, ""gurus"", books recommended on Amazon, all throwing their ideas/strategies around, the market has opportunities littered all over.. Decision Fatigue is inevitable for the unprepared. Decision Fatigue happens in every profession. If you mess up at your 9-5, its just a blunder, your paycheck will remain the same. Just a slap on the wrist and move on. With trading, you make a mistake.. it's less food on your table, lights don't stay on, and/or water isn't running. That pressure adds up. **No wonder so many fail...**

The signs of Decision Fatigue:

•Procrastination.

•Impulsivity.

•Avoidance.

•Indecision.

When you find what clicks with you AND its either statistically or performance proven, have the courage to risk a healthy sum of your capital into it. There are strategies/patterns/styles of trading littered all over the internet:

Very broad example:

""**IF** *circumstance happens* **THEN** *""Execution""*. *Stoploss is XYZ*. *Target is XYZ.* **BECAUSE** *over a series of Y trades, I will make $X,XXX.xx"".*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ProTip #6 :** *Strategies are all over the internet. It's your account/money, backtest it. People share their strategies here all the time and although I don't agree with them because I know what works for me, it's something to chew off of for you newer traders. YouTube is a harbor with people who give just enough info to figure their style out.* ***You will lose trades. Sit for some screen-time and pay homage to the edge that you discover. All in due time.***

&#x200B;

Insert key metrics and find correlations. This is how you create checks and balances to create/formulate a black and white trading plan. When I first started doing this, my spreadsheet(s) had so many columns it was annoying and would kill my desire to continue working. You'll find things that are imperative and some that are unimportant. For a lack of more colorful terms: *""Throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks""* **Trim the fat. Rinse and repeat.**

&#x200B;

# Here's some things I used to remind myself of and perhaps it'll ring some bells for you:

•**Surrender your capital to your edge**. If you truly accept the risk and trust your **proven** edge, losses don't feel like anything nor do profits. Although we're not here to put on losing trades and yes it does feel nice to profit. I still from time to time will excited when I hit target after a series of multiple profiting trades depending on my mood.

•**If you're nervous** or your heart starts beating quicker when you hear the sound effect of a trade getting entered/filled. Be honest with yourself and ask yourself if you're truly accepting the risk.

•**Things you can't take to the bank:**

1. RRR.
2. Win-Rate
3. Number of trades.
4. ""This one great trade that I hit target in less than 30 seconds and I got filled better than expected""

All of these are integral metrics. But you're trading to make money. **It's up or down, green or red, profit or loss, TRUE or FALSE**. So with that said, find what works flawlessly and is easy to follow. Checks and Balances. Then allocate a good sum of risk into it. I read it here all the time, ""Don't risk too much"" and that's great and true for new traders. But don't sell yourself short. Push yourself over the edge and admit that you know your stuff. Think of **Trader A** and **Trader B**. If you've put the time in.. don't sell yourself short. You've built enough courage to learn a business so many fail at. This business has such a negative connotation. But remember that not everybody can handle meritocracies and that's exactly what the market is. Don't try to be the best, just work harder than everyone else and the output of your input will be relative.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ProTip #7:** ***YouTube trading ads from gurus... they're subconsciously making you think you're a novice trader.*** *It's in their marketing. They study marketing psychology. The EASIEST things to sell:*

1. Health
2. Wealth
3. Happiness

People that are desperate for those things are the most vulnerable and these ~~""Traders""~~ marketers are fantastic at portraying all 3 of those things at once.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

•**ProTip #8** (***Broken record alert***) **:** *Write a business plan. Your strategy shouldn't take longer than 4 sentences to explain to another trader. When you have a plan that's proven through a statistic and WAIT for it to happen, you feel* ***100X*** *better taking the trade. You don't even care too much when it results in a loss. Because that was your plan, you accept it much better, and you know it was just an expense for a winning trade.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Want my strategy? *""I scan for stocks with a market cap of over 250M, 10k shares premarket, gapping to support or resistance, priced over $10, and I look for a pattern biased to the direction of the overnight gap.* It isn't rocket science. Check my Twitter, look at the dates I posted, and you'll notice the gist. Yes this is an edge but not the entire edge. How fast can you sift through 15 time frames? How long does it take you to fill out your order ticket? Your Fibonacci time extensions with 5 EMA's and Bollinger Bands aren't helping you. They're lagging. If they work for you, great. In my experience, they hindered my visibility.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Pro Tip #9**: *Yes statistics are highly applicable to trading. Patterns* ***do*** *work. All patterns do is tell you WHEN to enter/exit, and how many shares. Humans will never think differently of money. Be the frontrunner of the market's emotions. Nobody remembers the indecisive leader. Risk taking is a commonality amongst leaders. Trading requires courage and it's O.K. to show a bit of confidence as long as you also have the humility  to admit when you're in a bad trade.* ***(Notice how I didn't put, ""wrong"". You're only ""wrong"" when you deviate from a proven strategy.)***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ProTip #10:** *Risk management is 24/7. I've never heard anyone mention this but think about it a little bit. Having financial obligations can become stressful regardless of how you earn your income but its far more stressful while running a business. Not just any business, but a business where you can go to work on your A-game, do every single last thing right, trade without emotion etc... and still walk away with less money than what you came to work with. Meanwhile somebody who JUST started trading made a 4 figure profit not knowing what the heck the difference between* [ETB, HTB, or NTB](https://imgur.com/a/L0BO9oC)*. Think of it like this, a JV high school baseball player can hit a homerun off of an MLB pitcher once.. but how will he fare at the end of the season? Traders don't predict stock prices, traders predict the outcome over hundreds of trades. People chat me asking what TO do rather than what NOT to do. You don't learn labor intensive jobs or how to fly a plane by what to do.. you learn what NOT to do to stay alive.*

&#x200B;

That's all I have. Once you have a trading plan underway and you're executing it, you don't have much time when your hobbies are cheap but I still do respond to chats/messages. I do get asked from a previous post when I'll build a website and to answer that: I'm learning how to build a site on rainy days. Can't put a definitive date on it. I will say that its coming, if you don't give up on this business in the next year or so, you'll see it. What I plan on putting on there:

1. RiskReward Calculators
2. Position size Calculators
3. EV Calculator
4. Dictionary with examples

I just don't want some generic WordPress site. I want my website to be stellar and a great resource for aspiring traders. Something I didn't have learning this business. I want it to be something I'd consider a staple in a trader's resources. Perhaps one day it will be referenced on this sub frequently.

FAQ:

1. **""How do you prepare for a trading day?""** I get behind the computer about 20 minutes before the bell. Reason being: *""If you study long. You'll study wrong""*. If the chart isn't grabbing my attention and gets me excited, then I flick to the next ticker. I don't even know the companies I trade half the time nor do I care about a news report some journalist wrote. Also there is no magic news outlet that lets you know about ""Major events that affect stock prices"". If there was, I wouldn't be here because we're all subscribed to the same edge nor would I be trading my style.
2. **""What would you go back to tell yourself?""** Get more data. Save a little more, your hairline and sleep schedule will thank you. Take only perfect trades and don't feel forced to trade. There will be days you don't touch an order ticket. And days where you are busy and have tunnel vision. Next thing you know its time to shut it down for the day.
3. **""Books?"" -** I try to humble myself when answering this but off the cuff, they're all mediocre. Andrew Aziz's was ok, definitely get it, it's only a few bucks on Kindle. Just don't expect it to give you strategies BUT it will give you ideas. If you're brand new, it is good as it will teach you the common vernacular of a day trader. Mark Douglas was interesting but his YouTube seminar recordings are much better. No book, Facebook group, YouTube channel is going to be the end all be all perfect strategy. Expect losses. Don't be a one hitter quitter after suffering a few tiny losses/paper cuts. Stick to it. Most books will help you familiarize yourself with the common vocabulary amongst traders and will hint ideas. It's your job to formulate the strategy and template for research.
4. **""What is your background?""** I was a logistics planner for a major oilfield services company. Later I then became a data/buyer analyst so yes, data analytics/research was a **2nd** language for me entering trading. I did have that upper hand and did shave off months if not years for me.
5. **""What is a normal day for you?""** I'm always done trading after **10:30AM** Central. I will hold onto a trade until right before the bell if it hasn't hit either target or StopLoss by the time I leave the house but it is absolutely closed in entirety by **2:55PM** Central. After I trade, I enjoy the day. No I'm not riding around in my Lambos posting IG/Snapchat (I have neither) stories of my profits with my private jet waiting on a runway trying to sell an **$7** eBook or a **$100** membership (HINT HINT). I grill/cook, read, workout, ride my motorcycle, attack my other sources of income (small businesses I'm building), hit the driving range, shoot guns, etc. I live in Texas. Life is cheap and fun here.
6. **""How did you discover your strategy?""** I bought TradeIdeas premium, went through all of their computerized backtesting patterns, tested them. Then did what I mentioned earlier... Tried to find correlations in metrics. It distilled the trades to a strict criteria and here I am. I post on average 4-5 tickers on my watchlist. 7 max. I do not like spreading my attention thin across multiple tickers. I do not recommend buying TradeIdeas, it does have lots of bugs.
7. **""What did you do/How did you get started?""** Was a data analyst, was good at research and applied it to trading. My incentive was, ""I could have made more money trading rather than sitting in 2+ hours of roundtrip traffic and 9 hours in an office. The data is there. Everybody sees the same charts all over the world. There are ways to make this possible""
8. **""What is your % return?""** *(Not a fun question since a trading account is not an index or investment account. Intraday traders do not measure performance in %)* I trade to make money AND pay myself, so my equity curve will look like a small loss or small gain after I pay myself. **% return?** I measure my account's performance in [Sharpe Ratio](https://imgur.com/a/3ZWOpx0) and Risk Units. My Sharpe Ratio is **\~1.85**. While I yield roughly **.8 - 1 R** per trading day. Some weeks I make **10R**. Some weeks **I lose 2R**. Yeah one week I might make $2,500. But the next week I might lose $300. The following week my strategy will yield $0 and the last week I might make $1,000. Some weeks suck. Some weeks are great. But overall. Just shy of 1R per trading day. Some days I'm super busy taking trade after trade. Some days I'll shut it down after 5 minutes without even filling out an order ticket. Some days I won't even see the open because there is no edge for me.. **Keywords... ""For me"".**
9. **""Is <insert sum of money here> enough to start trading?""** Depends on where you live. Are you restricted to PDT? If not then how much are you obligated to expenses? **I live in Texas. Things are cheap here.** If you live in NYC or The Bay Area your expenses will be astronomical compared to mine. **A $30,000 account is totally doable for a single Texan with low monthly expenses.** Now if you're in California or New York? I'm sure you'll fall below 25k if you have 1 bad month. Also depends on if you have other sources of income or a full/part time job. I encourage every trader and aspiring trader to have multiple sources of income, don't rely solely on trading. Not just for the sake of mitigating pressure but also for sanity. If you have a family to provide for, I don't know what that's like, you never know when Little Johnny is going to randomly pick up Trombone lessons for a school program/play while little Suzie needs transmission work in her car because a simple solenoid went out. $1,700 later.
10. **""Why do you need so many monitors?""** **I use 3 for trading**. The 4th is for music. The other 2 are useless while trading. That's for trading though. When I made the decision to go full time, I knew I was about to go off the chain with research. And sifting between spreadsheets, a platform to see multiple timeframes for a pattern to backtest. My attention span is short, I'll lose my train of thought before I open the other tab to input data. But the main reason was for research. It's such a time saver and is a headache repellant when doing research while everything is laid out in front of you. Now that I have a system. I'll most likely be treating myself to 2 ultrawides for Christmas.

As always, thank you to everybody who takes time out to message me and letting me know some people read these and show appreciation. I would say, ""Good luck"" but there is no luck in trading. Just statistics. Remember that!

**In conclusion:** Yes. Full time trading is possible, depending where you live/monthly expenses and obligations. You're more likely to become a profitable trader than a professional athlete. There is a level of uncertainty each day, perhaps each week, doubtful each month, and definitely not each year. If I ever want a raise, I just consult my business plan and financials, then decide if I can handle it mentally. If you have medical issues, get a part time job for the benefits. If you're healthy, just be careful.

Stocks rose again today, extending yesterday’s frankly unexpected gains, with the major benchmarks opening at their highest levels in about a month. Market participants digested a new round of jobless claims, dimming hopes of stimulus, even for stand-alone bills, and progress in Covid-19 therapeutics following Pres. Trump’s discharge from the hospital.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.54% up. The S&P (SPY) led the day, up 0.85% and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.48% up. 

Today, the Labor Department released their weekly jobless claims report. There were 840,000 additional first-time jobless claims this week, slightly above the 820,000 prediction of analysts. While 840,000 is the lowest level since March, jobless claims have stagnated the past month, a sign of slowing economic recovery. Continuing claims, which are the number of people who have already filed an initial claim and who have experienced a week of unemployment and then filed a continued claim to claim benefits for that week of unemployment, fell below 11 million, dropping almost 1 million compared to the week before. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said, “The decline in continuing claims is welcome, but initial claims offer a better read on the real-time state of the labor market, and the downward trend has stalled, more or less.”

According to CNBC, there are still 25.5 million workers claiming some form of unemployment benefits, according to totals through Sept. 19. More than half that total, or about 13.4 million, comes from those collecting under pandemic-related programs set up for those who normally wouldn’t be eligible, showing the toll the pandemic has put on the labor market. 

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi further curbed expectations that any form of stimulus will be unleashed before the November election. Today, in response to a bill designed to provide relief to the airline industry, Pelosi said, “There is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill.” In other words, she opposes passing smaller, stand-alone stimulus bills in the absence of more comprehensive measures. Yesterday, after calling for his representatives to stop negotiations for overarching stimulus, Pres. Trump signaled he would support a smaller, targeted bill. In response to Trump’s recent tweets about stimulus, Ed Mills, policy analyst at Raymond James said, “It’s been the question of the day, as to why we got the tweets we got over the last 24 hours, the market reaction we got into \[Tuesday’s\] close, and then the rally.” Needless to say, the current market is hyper-responsive to the comments of Trump and other top officials.

Shares of Regeneron (REGN) jumped after the drugmaker said it had submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization of its Covid-19 antibody treatment, which had been taken by President Donald Trump after his Covid-19 diagnosis. In a video on Twitter today, Pres. Trump openly endorsed the move saying “I took this medicine \[during his stay at Walter Reed Hospital\] and it was incredible.”

In other nice news, the World Trade Organization (WTO) announced that South Korea’s trade minister and the former Nigerian finance minister are the two finalists in the race to become the next director-general. This is the first time a woman will occupy the position of top leader in this organization.

&#x200B;

**BJ -**  BJ's wholesale club is a Costco competitor with a much smaller marketcap. They crushed last earnings and soared to $47 before getting caught in the market downdraft in early September. It's currently range-bound between $39 - $42, but only until people remember how much of a beast this business is. Costco continues to report great quarterly and monthly numbers and the stock is crushing it, and that's good reason to think BJ's will too. This will easily be $50 by year-end, and could go as high as $80. Earnings is November 19, but I'm getting in early in case it catches an upgrade and starts to soar.

My advice: if it dips into the $39s, buy a little more than you want to hold so you can swing trade back above $41, likely within 48 hours. If you see a 38-handle, mortgage your wife's boyfriend's children and buy calls. $43 is a signal that the rocket is starting, so that's the last stop before moon.

**SNE -** Sony is another company that handily beat expectations last quarter and traded well after earnings, only to be forgotten and left behind by the market's rebound from it's September slump. The chart reminds me of Ebay two weeks ago. Sony reports earnings 10/28, but it has a lot more upside than downside closing out Friday at a 3-month low. I wouldn't be surprised by some nice price-action before the earnings call. Strong retail sales numbers bode well for Sony. I expect another great quarter.

Position: Nov 20 80c

An update on other recent names [I suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j3fu63/tickers_im_watching/):

**CHWY -** Broke out to the upside. Congrats call holders! I'm mostly in shares now plus some 1/21 $70c

**AAWW -** Set new highs, but I'm less confident in its continued march higher than I was

**UPS -** Underperforming Fedex, but setting higher lows and I think this stock will jump $10 higher sometimes before earnings on 10/28. I'm in Jan 21 $180c and Jun 21 $200c

**BYD -** Boyd Gaming is going to smash estimates when it reports on 10/26, but this is starting to become priced-in. This is my top performer of the week.

**ROKU -** Has exceeded my wildest expectations. I'm currently holding shares because I am getting nervous with how quick it went up. If there's a market crash and it dips 10%, I'd suggest picking up some calls. $300 by mid 2021 would be easy, up from current price of $220.

**OSTK -** I expect +100% or -50% by year end, depending on whether or not sales continue to benefit from COVID for this small-cap retailer. It's traded up slightly over the last two weeks, but remains range bound. There's no shame on FOMO-ing in after earnings on 11/9 if they are good, these shares could triple by the end of next year. I expect some run-up into earnings, but that could be complicated by election jitters.

**CWH -** It beat earnings in August and traded up to $42. Now down around $32. Traders are betting the COVID bump will be temporary. Hint: it's not. I'm expecting another monster quarterly report on 11/5, though election jitters could fuck with me. I'm holding many shares and Dec $35c.

**ECPG -** This debt collector just settled a lawsuit against it by the government for a slap on the wrist, setting it up to crush earnings again on 11/2. It's trading at just 3x annualized earnings from last quarter. A lot of you guys probably already are familiar with this company from its friendly phone calls. With stimmy money running out, I expect this chart is up and to the right. ",2020-10-16

# **Investors are hoping for a clear presidential and Senate election outcome to end the sell-off  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/30/investors-are-hoping-for-a-clear-presidential-and-senate-election-outcome-to-end-the-sell-off.html)**
*****
> The best hope for markets in the week ahead is that there is a clear cut winner in Tuesday’s presidential election.
*****
> The election looms large as the biggest wild card risk for markets, and there is a real concern that no outcome could lead to a period of uncertainty and turbulence for markets and the economy. On the other hand, some strategists say a clear winner and quick concession by the other candidate could lead to a relief rally. Also a worry is that Senate elections could be unresolved, which means it may not be known which party holds the majority.
*****
> “If there’s no clear winner, it will be negative for risk assets...The market is really worried about not having clarity after the election. They’re worried about it dragging out four weeks as the results are contested,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. “The overall landscape is not a political one. It’s that we’re in a pandemic, and we don’t want an uncertain election outcome that leaves the country concerned about leadership.”
*****
> Stocks closed out October on a sour note, losing about 6% for the week, the worst performance since March, when the pandemic first shut down the economy. Strategists say the coronavirus is again worrying the market, as major European countries go into partial lockdowns, and the U.S. faces record numbers of new cases.
*****
> Lyngen said he does not expect the markets to react as much if it’s only the fate of the Senate that is undetermined. But that is still very important, and if it’s not clear which party has a majority for days or even weeks, that would cast doubt on the ability of whichever candidate wins the presidency to pursue their policy agenda.
*****
> # Senate key for stimulus
> The Senate is also key to how much money will be poured into the economy to help battle the impact of the virus. For instance, if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the White House, but Democrats do not reclaim the Senate, he will likely have to compromise on a smaller stimulus package and would not be able to implement tax increases. If President Donald Trump is re-elected and faces a newly Democratic Senate alongside the Democratic House, he will likely face push back on many issues though they may agree on a large stimulus package.
*****
> As of Friday, Biden was leading Trump in the polls by 7.8 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of major polls. Democrats also appear likely to take the Senate, but some races are very tight.
*****
> Bank of America strategists note that the Senate races are close with a few seats that could flip. Seven Republican seats are currently rated as toss-ups with four in battleground states, where they could be lost if there’s a strong Democratic surge. There could also be a clear majority, but still uncertainty in terms of final makeup.
*****
> “The overall composition of the Senate is unlikely to be determined until sometime in January due to election rules in Georgia which stipulates the race goes to a run off if no candidates garners 50% majority in the general election and currently no candidate is projected” to hit that threshold, the BofA strategists wrote.
*****
> The strategists say the timing of the results is unclear due to early voting but high volumes of mail-in ballots, which cannot be counted in some states until election day.
*****
> “A short delay in the election result should have a trivial impact on the economy but a multi-week contested election could drag down H1 GDP growth by 0.5-1.0 pp,” according to BofA strategists. “Once there is a winner, the focus turns to stimulus.”
*****
> # Watch bond yields
> That could mean bond yields will continue their move higher in the coming week. Yields have been rising on the idea that there will be some kind of stimulus after the election, and it will mean more U.S. debt and higher interest rates.
*****
> “We expect rates to shift higher by 5 to 25 bps after the election outcome is known due to expectations for fiscal stimulus and improved growth prospects,” the BofA strategists wrote. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 0.86% Friday.
*****
> However, if the election outcome is not known for awhile, the strategists said a contested outcome could push the 10-year yield materially lower.
*****
> If there is a contested election, the strategist expect stocks to trade lower, but it would be a buying opportunity since the market typically recovers from headline-related losses within six months.
*****
> “We expect a clear outcome to be neutral to positive for the market in the near term, except under a Biden win with a split Congress, which could potentially lead to continued gridlock in fiscal stimulus talks,” the BofA strategists added.
*****
> Besides the election, there is also a Fed meeting, expected to end Thursday with no new announcements though it is likely the Fed will emphasize it will keep policy easy for a long time as the economy heals. The October employment report is expected on Friday and is expected to show continued job gains, after September’s 661,000 nonfarm payrolls.
*****
> Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equities strategist at Credit Suisse, does not expect the market to react much if the election outcome is as expected, with Biden winning and Democrats taking the Senate.
*****
> “The most likely outcome is already discounted by the market. The best assumption is if you don’t have a big surprise, the market should do nothing,” Golub said, adding the most volatile week could be the one just ending. “This week is the one with the turmoil, and I don’t think the next week is the one where the market’s going to be crazy.”
*****
> Golub said investors may be too worried about the election being unresolved and the real issue disturbing the market this past week is the growing spread of the virus.
*****
> “There’s no rule we need to declare a victor,” said Golub. “We have four or five weeks. The market may not love that near-term indecision, but the system is set up to allow for it, and as long as things don’t go off the rails, and they really shouldn’t, this concern about a contested election is probably overblown as an investor issue.”
*****
> Golub said there’s a greater chance that the winner of the presidency is known before the Senate. “The chances are that we’ll at least know directionally where the power sits, but that could take a little longer and the market may be a little uncomfortable with that,” he said.
*****
> # Earnings reports
> Dozens of companies report earnings in the week ahead, and Golub said corporate profits are a bright spot for the market. The third quarter results so far are showing earnings down about 10%, compared to earlier forecasts of more than 20%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> “The reality is the economy is robust. 55% of the market cap of the S&P has higher earnings in 2020 than in 2019. More than half the market is acting like there’s no recession, no downturn,” Golub said.
*****
> Golub said both Trump and Biden would push for fiscal stimulus, but while the market is clear on where Trump stands it does not know that much about Biden, if he were to win. “It is going to take some time to get clarity on which of his policy initiatives are going to happen. I don’t believe he’s going to implement these tax increases he’s talking about right away. I think the economy is too frail,” said Golub.

> # November Almanac: Usually a Top Month in Election Years

> November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.

> November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950), NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 2000 (since 1979) month. November is best for S&P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 1000 (since 1979).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/43b1cac3b88cfc6f79063d86ae9abfef/57e8d7f397fbeeb8-7f/s400x600/a8bff5e250ce7b9735197427f72d665b61fe0614.jpg))**

> November is a mixed bag in presidential election years. DJIA has advanced in 10 of the last 17 election years since 1952 with an average gain of 1.7%. Significant DJIA declines occurred in 2008 (-5.3%) and 2000 (-5.1%). For S&P 500 November ranks best with a similar record to DJIA. NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 are not as strong ranking #7, #3 and #6 respectively. Fewer years of data (12 for NASDAQ and 10 for Russell indices) combined with sizable losses in 2000 and 2008 drag down rankings and average gains when compared to DJIA and S&P 500.

*****

> # Whatever the Outcome, Day Before Election Day Historically Bullish

> Looking back at the last seventeen presidential elections since 1952, the day before Election Day has a clear bullish bias. DJIA and S&P 500 have declined just three times and average gains of 0.51% and 0.44% respectively. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly weaker, but still bullish. Election Day (or the day after prior to 1980) leans bullish, but with a greater frequency of losses. Incumbent party victories are shaded in light grey.

> # GDP Bounces Back

> The outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns triggered the largest quarter over-quarter decline in gross domestic product (GDP) since WWII, so perhaps it comes as no surprise that the following quarter tallied the sharpest rebound in that same time period. GDP expanded 33.1% on an annualized basis in the third quarter, ahead of Bloomberg consensus expectations of 32%, fueled by the continued reopening of businesses and reversing much of the economic fallout stemming from COVID-19-related lockdowns.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, consumer spending—the largest contributor to GDP in the US and roughly 70% of economic output—rebounded in a powerful fashion in the third quarter.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.29.20-Blog-Chart.jpg?ssl=1))**

> However, spending numbers were uneven, with a considerably larger portion spent on goods rather than services—consistent with the continued behavioral and business restriction effects on these industries. Further, the timing of spending was also fairly uneven, as much of the growth in consumer spending came in the early weeks of the third quarter and tapered off in recent weeks where the effects of fiscal stimulus and rising new COVID-19 cases influenced consumer behavior.

> “GDP rebounded stronger than expected in the third quarter, but the big question on everyone’s mind is whether the economy can remain on firm ground in the fourth quarter and into 2021,” stated LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Barring a new round of fiscal stimulus, it’s likely that growth will taper off in the fourth quarter, but we still don’t expect a double-dip recession.”

> Regardless of the state of economic momentum, it is remarkable that GDP is already only about 3.5% away from recovering the entire pandemic losses. The resilience of US consumers has been the top story of the recovery, even with the historic fiscal stimulus.

> The surge in growth in the third quarter may also have political implications. As we noted in our recent Weekly Market Commentary: Are the Polls Wrong Again? the average GDP growth in the second and third quarters of election years can have predictive power for who wins the election, with stronger growth favoring incumbents. However, we also point out that recessions close to elections have favored challengers, sending some conflicting market signals heading into Election Day!

> As the economy moves forward in the fourth quarter, we’ll continue to monitor real-time data indicators to gauge the impact of rising COVID-19 cases on consumer and business behavior.

*****

> # Slight Dip In Consumer Confidence

> Consumer Confidence for the month of October was released earlier today and showed a slight dip relative to September. The headline index dropped from 101.3 down to 100.9 compared to expectations for a reading of 102.0. Given the rising number of cases and the upcoming election, it's not too surprising to see confidence come in a bit, so a decline of this magnitude isn't all that concerning. What is notable, though, is that even though Consumer Confidence remains right near post-COVID highs, it hasn't bounced all that much off its lows.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC.png))**

> Breaking out this month's report by the sentiment of consumers towards both how they feel now and what they expect in the future, the Present Situation Index rose from 98.9 up to 104.6 while the Expectations component dropped from 102.9 down to 98.4. The drop in the Expectations component of this month's report looks like it's a partial reflection of growing uncertainty regarding COVID and the election as we head into the colder months of November and December.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-P-Exp.png))**

> In looking at the spread between Present Conditions and Expectations, it moved back into positive territory this month after dropping deeply into negative territory earlier this year. What's interesting to note about current levels is that in every prior recession since the late 1960s, by the time the spread moved back into positive territory after turning negative, the recession was already well in the rearview mirror.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-CC-Spread.png))**

> Sentiment towards jobs also suggests a relatively positive trend. At the current level of 26.5, the Jobs Plentiful index is still far from its 40+ reading before COVID, but it did increase again in October as it has now done in four of the last five months. While it's by no means a strong reading at current levels, it hasn't been getting worse either. Looking at past recessions, it wasn't until well after the recession ended that the Jobs Plentiful index started to rebound.

*****

> # Industrials Malfunction

> With poorly received earnings reports from 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT) and general weakness overall, Tuesday was just a bad day for the Industrials sector. Just five stocks in the sector were up on the day and the sector overall was down 2.2% compared to the S&P 500 which was down just 0.3%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials-Sector-Perfoamnces.png))**

> The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the S&P 500 and the Industrials sector over the last year. Positive readings indicate the S&P 500 outperforming the Industrials sector and negative readings indicate that the Industrials sector outperformed the S&P 500. With the S&P 500 outperforming the Industrials sector by 1.88 percentage points on Tuesday, it was the widest performance gap (in the S&P 500's favor) since 9/21. Even more notable, though, was the fact that there have only been three other days in the last year where the Industrials sector underperformed the S&P 500 by a wider margin.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102720-Industrials-Sector-Spread.png))**

> For the sector as a whole, it currently finds itself in a precarious position. After breaking its uptrend off the March lows on 9/21, the Industrials sector bounced back and rallied back to its former uptrend line, and while it just recently made a post-COVID high, the rally ran out of steam right at the former uptrend line. In the pullback that has followed, the sector closed yesterday right at a secondary line of support from the June lows. If this level doesn't hold through today's close, the technical picture for the sector will look a lot different than the way it looked just a few weeks ago.

*****

> # All or Nothing Days Back on the Rise

> The S&P 500's A/D line for the day (number of advancing stocks minus number of declining stocks) currently stands at about -460, which would be the weakest one-day reading since June. Today's A/D reading also is notable in that it represents the tenth 'all or nothing' day for the S&P 500 since the index's last peak on 9/2. We consider 'all or nothing' days to be those days where the S&P 500's daily A/D reading is either above +400 or below -400. To put the frequency of 'all or nothing' days into perspective, while there have been ten in the last forty trading days, in the forty trading days before that there weren't any.

> The chart below shows the percentage of 'all or nothing' days on a 50-day rolling basis. The current pace of 20% is still well off the extraordinary level of 44% we saw back in late April/early May, but it is still relatively high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102820-AllorNothing-50.png))**

> Including today, there have now been 41 'all or nothing' days so far in 2020. If the current pace for the entire year keeps up that will put us on pace for fifty days this year. If the current pace keeps up and we do reach 50 'all or nothing' days this year, it will be the third-highest annual total behind 2011 (70) and 2008 (52), but even if there isn't another 'all or nothing' day this year, 2020 would still rank fifth behind the years from 2008 through 2011.

> # Earnings and Economics Diverge

> This earnings season, we have frequently mentioned how beat rates have continued to rise relentlessly. From our Earnings Explorer database, our 3-month rolling EPS beat rate currently stands at a record high of 78.19%. That is nearly 20 percentage points higher than the historical average of 59.37%. The sales beat rate is not at a record, but it too is elevated at 69.09% versus the historical average of 56.45%. That means that of the companies that have reported earnings over the past three months, a massive proportion are exceeding consensus sales and EPS estimates.

> While earnings beat rates have continued to grind higher, economic data is another story. The Citi Economic Surprise Index basically tracks macroeconomic data and how it comes in relative to forecasts. Higher readings indicate the data is trending stronger than expected and vice versa for negative readings. With the unprecedented shock to macroeconomic data in 2020, this index for the United States plummeted, but that was followed by a sharp rebound to record highs. Although the index for the US remains higher than anything prior to the pandemic, it has been heading lower since the summer. In other words, economic data is still coming in better than expected but is not massively exceeding expectations to the degree it was back in the spring and early summer.

> The two charts below compare EPS and revenue beat rates to the Citi Economic Surprise Index. Comparing the two series to the Citi Economic Surprise Index shows that while EPS beat rate has been somewhat connected (correlation: +0.325)) there is very little in the way of correlation between the Surprise Index and the revenue beat rate (+0.084). Given that EPS figures are typically easier to massage than revenues, that was a bit of a surprise. What is notable about the recent decline in the Citi Economic Surprise Index is that in prior periods where it became elevated and then pulled back as it did in (2003, 2009, and 2018), the EPS beat rate typically didn't peak and start to trend lower for another few months.

**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**

Comstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.

She bought \~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.

---

**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***

Lowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.

If I had to guess, I'd say Lowenthal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.

---

**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***

The Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A lesser man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.

---

**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**

***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***

Pat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.

Insider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.

WSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.

---

**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**

***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***

Marshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.

What Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.

**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**

***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***

The story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.

On July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.

Although he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.

Sadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.

After holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up.",2020-11-06
jpdg8t,42,341,StockMarket,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, November 6, 2020. Please enjoy!",0.97,1604725560.0,1604696760.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, November 6, 2020**

Stocks took a breather today, trading slightly lower after a continuous four-day rally. Market participants closely await the results of the US presidential election. The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.07% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.02% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the worst, 0.26% down on the day.

Today, the Labor Department released a better-than-expected October jobs report. The report shows that there were 638,000 non-farm jobs added to the economy versus the 580,000 expectation. The unemployment rate was 6.9%, compared to the 7.6% expectation (unemployment rate in September was 7.9%). The job report is surprisingly good, given the recent surge in coronavirus cases across the United States. 

The US Presidential Election remains the key focal point for market participants and Wall Street. Because of the surge of mail-in ballots, three days after Election Day several key swing states, including Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania,  have yet to announce results. According to the Associated Press, Joe Biden has 264 electoral votes to President Trump’s 214. Candidates need 270 electoral votes to win the election. As of this morning, Joe Biden took a very slim lead in Georgia and Pennsylvania and has increased his lead in Nevada. Below are the states that have been called, according to the Associated Press:

* States called for Trump: Ky., W. Va., S.C., Ala., Miss., Tenn., Okla., Ark., Ind., N.D., S.D., Wyo., La., Neb. (4 of 5 electoral votes), Kan., Mo., Idaho, Utah, Ohio, Iowa, Mont., Fla., Texas
* States called for Biden: Vt., Va., Conn., Del., Ill., Md., Mass., N.J., R.I., N.Y., N.M., D.C., Colo., N.H., Calif., Ore., Wash., Hawaii, Minn., Ariz., Maine (3 of 4 electoral votes), Wis., Mich.

A win for Biden is looking increasingly likely, given he only needs to win one more of the battleground states in order to take the White House. During a press conference yesterday afternoon he said that he had “no doubt” that once the counting was complete he and Kamala Harris “will be declared winners.” Trump, on his part, has doubled down on his calls “stop the count”, baselessly alleging widespread fraud during the election. His campaign has already sued multiple battleground states to challenge to ballot-counting process. A vote in Miching denied Trump’s efforts. 

Despite some of the uncertainty still surrounding the election, stocks rallied strongly again in the immediate aftermath of Election Day. According to a number of analysts, traders like a divided government, where no single party would control each of the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives. Under that scenario, major policy changes are unlikely to get advanced.

""Living well is the best revenge"" -George Herbert",2020-11-06
jrcj8y,91,141,stocks,"Pandemic 'stay at home stocks' like Peloton, Zoom, Roku tank on Pfizer vaccine news—is it an overreaction?",0.96,1605004897.0,1604976097.0,"Pfizer on Monday morning [announced that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-114500360.html), developed in partnership with BioNTech, was more than 90% effective in studies and that it could distribute 50 million doses before the end of this year, and 1.3 billion doses in 2021.

The good news immediately sent [U.S. markets broadly higher](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/election-2020-stock-market-news-updates-november-9-2020-231320807.html)—especially airline stocks, energy names, bank stocks, in-person entertainment like theme parks, and real estate—except for a slew of key names that have seen huge gains during the pandemic, boosted by prolonged work-from-home trends.

Those “stay-at-home stocks” were hit hard.

Peloton ([PTON](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PTON/)) fell by as much as 25%; Logitech ([LOGI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LOGI/)) fell 19%; Zoom Video ([ZM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZM/)) dropped 17%; CrowdStrike ([CRWD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWD/)) fell 11%; Chewy ([CHWY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CHWY/)) fell 10%; Roku ([ROKU](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ROKU/)) sunk 7%; Netflix ([NFLX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/)) fell 6%; Slack ([WORK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WORK/)) was down 4%.

The market thinking appears to be: a widely available vaccine will prompt a return to normalcy, which will mean the end of the hockey-stick run for products and services you use in your home.

But that reductive logic doesn’t apply equally well to every stay-at-home name. Rather, the post-pandemic prospects for each business have to be examined on a case-by-case basis.

## Remote work won’t abruptly end with a vaccine

Since early on in the pandemic, analysts and experts have predicted that some form of [remote work](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-a-remote-work-boom-will-affect-salaries-jobs-and-where-people-live-190344317.html) is here to stay—after all, it was a trend already growing before the pandemic. If that’s the case, then many companies are going to continue to use enterprise tools like Zoom and Slack, even once offices reopen. Whether workers are in their office or at home, teams that use Slack aren’t going to just stop using it.

In Zoom’s case, the stock has also become extremely expensive. It trades at more than 800 times earnings, so it was arguably due for a big correction. The vaccine news provided an excuse for firms to take some profit and move into other names, like the battered stocks set to take off now that a vaccine is imminent. (As for Slack, increased competitive threat from Microsoft Teams is also contributing to its slide.)

The same “here to stay” thinking with the enterprise names can apply broadly to streaming services like Netflix and Roku: just because people might return to their offices doesn’t mean they will stop streaming at home.

In Roku’s case, the dip makes a little more sense, since Roku relies on ad revenue from ads on its home screen, and advertisers might indeed shuffle their budgets away from Roku if they think time spent on streaming will drop significantly. For Netflix, which makes its revenue from subscriptions (it doesn’t sell ad space or sell user data), the stock dive would only make sense if you think a significant number of subscribers will cancel Netflix after the pandemic.

Peloton is its own case: the exercise-bike company took off early in the pandemic amid staggering demand for its bikes, creating wait times of 5-10 weeks on orders. As the stock surged, some analysts warned of a “pull-forward in demand,” the idea that Peloton cannot sustain this level of sales and would be punished later on because shareholder expectations would get too high. But in its [fourth-quarter earnings report in September](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peloton-new-highs-q4-earnings-and-revenue-202044922.html), Peloton had its first profit and showed massive continued demand for its bikes, making the bear case look wrong. (Meanwhile, Netflix, in contrast, actually did see in Q3, and explicitly identified, a [pull-forward in demand from the first half of 2020 that hurt its subscription adds](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflixs-q-3-demonstrates-the-dreaded-pandemic-pullforward-in-demand-193405344.html).) Once gyms fully reopen across the country, will Peloton bike sales really dry up?

On the other hand, Peloton stock, like Zoom, got extremely expensive (trading at a 15x P/E ratio), so it was due for a correction as soon as there was any indication that the end of the pandemic is in sight.

## Buy online, pick up in store

One good example of a trend accelerated by the pandemic that is generally expected not to reverse is e-commerce and the rise of BOPIS (buy online, pick up in store) for brick-and-mortar retail.

[Walmart, Target, Best Buy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-and-target-huge-ecommerce-gains-are-a-blaring-siren-to-brickandmortar-retail-192709224.html), Urban Outfitters, [Restoration Hardware](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-restoration-hardware-stock-is-up-240-during-the-pandemic-180244236.html), and [Dick’s Sporting Goods](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dicks-sporting-goods-is-wildly-outperforming-amid-the-pandemic-195504143.html) are just some of the physical retail names seeing enormous e-commerce gains, so much so that the share of U.S. retail spending attributed to e-commerce has surged to 16.1%, up from 10.8% one year ago.

Those chains have also seen [huge customer adoption of curbside pickup](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/curbside-pickup-is-exceptionally-sticky-and-will-continue-postpandemic-mc-kinsey-retail-expert-183712446.html). Dick’s Sporting Goods president Lauren Hobart said in August that Dick’s “anticipated originally that we would see a large drop-off \[in curbside\] when the stores reopened, but that is not the case.” Many retail analysts predict that even after the pandemic, consumers will stick with their new behavior and shop online, for home delivery or curbside pickup.

Whole Foods CEO [John Mackey disagrees](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whole-foods-ceo-does-not-think-online-grocery-will-remain-the-norm-postpandemic-food-is-different-175009302.html)—he thinks some people will stick to online ordering, but that it won’t remain the norm for most. Even if he’s right, what that creates is a hybrid landscape for physical retail and physical grocery.

The same applies to remote work: even if a large number of workers return to the office, many more workers than before the pandemic are going to keep working from home, which should be good for enterprise names like Zoom, Slack, and CrowdStrike.

Wharton professor Mauro Guillen writes in his new book, “2030: How Today’s Biggest Trends Will Collide and Reshape the Future of Everything,” that beyond the pandemic we should expect a “hybrid model” of working that allows for remote-work a few days a week, and continued automation of service warehouses.

“Most of what I hear from companies right now is that we're going to go to a hybrid model,” [Guillen told Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/whartons-mauro-guillen-trends-shape-203000781.html) in August. “So, a majority of American employees who are working from home now, they're saying, ‘Yes, I would like to have a remote component in my work week, but I would like to also go to the office.’”

Logitech CEO Bracken Darrell sounds a similar tune. He insists that the recent sales boom for Logitech’s computer accessories [can’t be totally chalked up the pandemic, but to four “secular” shifts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/logitech-ceo-4-trends-are-driving-our-sales-boost-not-just-the-pandemic-141208902.html): “One is video going everywhere, whether it’s offices or webcams. The second one is the rise of gaming as a professional sport, and as a bigger and bigger spectator sport; it’ll be the biggest collection of sports in the world one day. The third one is working from anywhere. The fourth is everybody creating their own content and streaming it, which lends itself well to our microphones. All four of those are long-term secular trends.”

But of course, Darrell has to hope so for his business. The other companies labeled “stay at home names” during the pandemic are all hoping their momentum continues, even once we get a vaccine.

Hey everyone and Welcome to my channel, so let’s start with a recap of the stock markets yesterday As the Nasdaq bounced back with a jump of 2% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/DVfGGSL)  while the S&P followed the lead and rose 0,7% [SP CHART](https://ibb.co/LzJNVLQ) while the Dow finally took a breather and was barely down for the day [DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/K9pPfJ2). The volatility index continued to drop past that level of 25 for the first time since the last 2 months [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/CV3JBkG). Yesterday we saw pretty much an even market as the advancing to declining stocks were even while 78 made new high and just 12 made new lows. The volume finally slowed down a little after the huge first 2 days of trading this week due to the Pfizer vaccine news [ADVANCING](https://ibb.co/VCdkLBK). We saw tech with over 45% and consumer discretionary with over 25% of the companies up more than 2% to put them back on track while there were no obvious losers energy and industrial did take a break from the huge run they had [CHART](https://ibb.co/mtrP7gQ). We also saw momentum and growth stocks outperform the value plays as well as small caps and dividend plays especially with large caps leading the way [CHART](https://ibb.co/fFzQ7xB).As some pandemic favorites have return to flavor for investors with the likes of Zoom, Shopify and other being up from they’re lows.  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qk5hRVk)

[SP500 Heat MAP](https://ibb.co/xSk4y0n) | [WORLD HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/qW4dFKY)

We have to be vey aware of the stock market as investors have made a huge sentiment shift as we saw a jump of 18% in bullish investors and a decline of almost 7% in bearish as we are way above historical averages [INVESTORS SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/CtZfLPP). This usually is a bad contrarian indicator for the market as the time to invest is usually when other people are scared or afraid to put money in the stock market. We could potentially see a correction of the stock market especially with cases rising of Covid-19 and with the number of deaths trailing this by about a month, we could see huge numbers that could scare investors in the next month or so. Add to this the volatility that is expected to arrive around the Georgia runoff election this is a serios thing to consider. It may be better to wait for the next correction to put money into the stock market. Here is a chart of the SP500 and the VIX being inversely corelated as you can see whenever he vix sees a spike the sp goes down but with every even that caused volatility the market has recovered and has made new highs after that. [VIX to SP](https://ibb.co/wsXZG92)

Before this next point I have to tell you that I have no partisan view as I am not a resident or citizen of the US. So though already announced by many as the next President, Biden win % as dropped slightly after the first days of the election results this probably is due to the fact that Trump is not willing to concede and continues with his legal ballots [BIDEN %](https://ibb.co/ZTvYnZL), so I don’t think this will lead to anything and expect Biden to take-over in January but the more important thing for the stock market investors is that big changes are very unlikely as the Senate has a more than 80% chance of being controlled by the Republicans [SENATE RACE](https://ibb.co/99KXKyN) which will likely deny any chances for the Democrats to raise any taxes or to do any radical left ideas. So, this bolds very well as the stock market loves the most that things don’t change to often and it also loves to not have unknowns.

So, Moderna also has announced that they will soon publish the vaccine study for they’re candidate [MODERNA NEWS](https://ibb.co/SKxWZCn), if we do see great results in this vaccine I believe the market will react very good to the news, as every new vaccine can take us higher as a whole market especially led by the SP and the Dow Jones. As there has been some doubt to the Pfizer vaccine as the CEO sold more than 5 million $ worth of stock on the same day they made the announcement even if it was a scheduled sale this has made people have some doubts about the results [CEO SALE](https://ibb.co/d5Lvsnq). So as you can see the next results that we are expecting for vaccines candidates are from Moderna, AstraZeneca, J&J and Novavax. I believe the next 3 will be pretty important for a better market outlook. [NEXT VACCINES](https://ibb.co/LQ9nCV1)

Also, other good news came from the UK as they save a growth of more than 15% in the 3rd quarter, though the economy is still down more than 8% from before the pandemic this seems to be a good recovery track that has been unfortunately derailed a little probably with the latest lockdown in the UK. [UK ECONOMY](https://ibb.co/G99q89g)

While Goldman just raised the price target for the SP by 100points for year end as they expect to see a huge growth next year of better than 1000points from where the SP sits now [NEWS](https://ibb.co/bmWhcSR)

Today we have some interesting earnings results with the ones that I will watch most being Disney and Palantir as the analysts estimate a loss of 70 cents vs a more than 1$ profit just a year ago for Disney [DISNEY EXPECTATIONS](https://ibb.co/Ctv0gqn) . But the more important aspect to watch I believe is how well or bad Disney+ is doing, if they deliver another great round of subscriber growth this will be a huge positive for the company which has seen it’s parks revenue plunge with the pandemic this year with lots of jobs being cut that did eventually help with lowering the costs for the company.

While Walmart just announced that they will test driverless delivery next year, this could be a huge cost saver for the biggest employer in the US. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/7KpkWGB)

Also, Roku just announce that they will add apple airplay support to the system with added benefits for HBO Max users, this continues to improve the product and service Roku provide, as I expect them to continue to expand as traditional cable TV is a dying business. [ROKU NEWS](https://ibb.co/ZxwVPTK)

Great news for car companies and EV companies from China as they announced a rise of over 10% in October as the pandemic eases overseas. With passenger vehicles sales rising by 9% while EV’s and plug-in sales increase to 160.000 thousand, this are great news for companies like General Motors, Tesla and others.

Stocks rallied Monday, for the third straight week, after more positive vaccine news from AstraZeneca (AZN). The current surge in infections and hospitalizations across the US emphasizes the need for an effective vaccine to combat the virus. Despite record infections, the market has been broadly encouraged by the steady stream of good vaccine news the last three weeks.

Over the weekend, AstraZeneca (AZN) and the University of Oxford announced the results of their clinical trail which showed their vaccine candidate was highly effective at 90%, relatively cheap, and easy to store. The results are based on analysis of a study involving 11,363 participants in the UK and Brazil. Moreover, the company announced the vaccine can be stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees Celsius (36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning distribution can be done with existing infrastructure. These developments came on the heels of Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) announcing plans to file for an emergency use authorization with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which would allow them to have their vaccine used in the U.S. starting in December.

A successful vaccine is seen by market participants as a necessary component for safe, sustained, and broad economic reopening. According to Yahoo Finance, an estimated 27 million workers, around 22% of the workforce, work in close physical proximity with others. In order to safely and fully reopen the economy and return to some semblance of normalcy, a vaccine is a crucial component. However, it is essential to note that even after approval by the requisite agencies, the production and distribution of literally billions of vaccine doses will be a massive and challenging logistical undertaking, unlikely to happen until 2021.

Expectations for relatively quick distribution of a vaccine have boosted the broader market this month and analyst expectations for 2021, despite the recent surge in cases. Cyclical and reopening stocks, that had previously underperformed are rallying, while previously high-flying, stay-at-home stocks, like Peleton (PTON), Zoom (ZM), and Netflix (NFLX) to retreat. However, given the uncertainty in Washington surrounding the election and stimulus and record Covid-19 infections, we expect volatility to keep up in the short-term. 

**Highlights**

* According to sources familiar with the matter, Biden has chosen Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen for Treasury Secretary.
* Snapchat (SNAP) launched Tik-Tok like feature called Spotlights that let’s users share short videos. Stock did well today, outperforming the broader market.

Let’s discuss this and more**

Hey everyone and Welcome , so let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 big indexes drop with the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/r63grbk) being down 0,42%, finishing the week up 0,2%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9whHcdZ) down 0,68% and finishing 0,8% down for the week while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/9V3z9jd) lost 3 quarters of a percent as this was also the same percentage that it dropped for the week. The VIX went up 2,5% but finished the week flat as it has for the past couple of weeks after the election. There was about an even split of companies advancing to declining as the volume continues to drop. Though there was a sharp sell-off in the last 30minutes to end the trading week as I believe a lot of people don’t want to hold the money in the stock market over the weekend as cases of the illness rise in the US. [CHART](https://ibb.co/8gb1Csf) / [VIX](https://ibb.co/WsNMvGv)

Here is the heat map from yesterday and the heat map for the whole week and it’s obvious that this was a pretty much mixed week as financials and energy sectors have recovered a little bit of the ground they lost during the last 8 months of recovery while the leaders of the recovery, the big tech struggled a little this week. [FRIDAY](https://ibb.co/r7QFV0m) / [WEEK](https://ibb.co/9VWyGGH)

Next week is pretty low on interesting earnings though I think I am going to try and buy some small pieces for companies like Best Buy, GAP and Hormel as I believe they may have some upside potential, I also think Dick’s sporting goods will do good but I think the expectations are a little high for that company and despite meeting the analyst expectations the retail investors might jump off the bandwagon and the stock may suffer. [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/56yWLs9)

Also, important economic data will only come until Wednesday as the stock market and economic data take a break for Thanksgiving. The most important numbers coming are the MARKIT PMI’s, the consumer confidence index and a lot of critical data that comes in on Wednesday as you can see here [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/ZKHM2cD).

The worst performing sectors on Friday were financials, industrials and surprisingly technology also, while the only real bright spot were communication services. [CHART](https://ibb.co/Df47v43)

Some great news for online retailers came in as the first week of November saw a more than 80% increase in online shopping traffic with 20% less traffic around malls vs last year but an almost 60% increase since March. The rise of e-commerce is still expected to continue big in the next years as analysts expect sales to grow between 25 and 35%. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/YfWJJ4W) / [NEWS](https://ibb.co/KWFF2Dy) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/9wmFS0w)

Moving on, two of the biggest giants in the tech sector and in the whole world, Apple and Microsoft also announced that they will team up to create a controller supported for IOS devices as the gaming industry has seen a huge spike and is expected to have huge growth in the coming years while Microsoft also seems to be targeting Zoom as they are removing the 40minute limit starting on Thanksgiving and are offering free all-day video calling via the TEAMS app. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/0mwb9KR)

Just take care and don’t rush into winners just because they are up huge this year, look at companies that have potential just like DraftKings and Penn Gaming, as the companies have huge tailwind especially legalized gambling in more and more states with a growing online presence and sports expected to have big returns in the next years. With Boeing being another company that might struggle in the short-term but for the long-term I believe is still a great company to own as they are expected to also have the 737 max banning lifted in Europe in the next couple of months. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/pwq0M2g) / [NEWS](https://ibb.co/G5hLmzq)

Also, car makers are getting more and more stamps of approval as they transition into the EV world, as 2 big Detroit giants GM and Ford are making a huge push to compete in the EV market with Tesla. The most recent was a buy rating from UPS on GM as they set the price at 50$ which implies a 16% upside.[NEWS](https://ibb.co/R3Y0WBP)

Just a quick mention as Netflix saw its stock up more than 1,5% on Friday as the company has struggled to regain momentum after weaker than expected growth in the last earnings report and has been dragged down by people selling the company after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine news. I still believe this is a great company as they and Disney will be the two biggest players in the streaming business in my opinion in the long run while ROKU also seems to be benefiting a lot from the dying of traditional TV as they are hitting all-time highs both in value for the company and subscribers. [ROKU NEWS](https://ibb.co/HFxLjQ2) / [NETFLIX](https://ibb.co/729dGWq) / 

So guys stay safe for the holidays as danger is still around, with the CDC urging people to not travel at home and also be safe while investing as the rift between the Treasury and the Fed may bring some volatility to the market unless a stimulus is passed by the time Biden taxes over even if the programs that will not be extended are not critical for the economy as they acted more like a backup in case of emergency. I believe the US should take the same approach as the UK which plans to present its biggest borrowing plan since World War Two. [UK NEWS](https://ibb.co/R40cy6n) / [TREASURY NEWS](https://ibb.co/nkRCR0X)

Don’t rush into the market if you missed the rally until now as I believe there are a lot of people who kept cash on the sidelines and missed the best moments to invest this year as the human mind plays tricks on us, just try to stay sharp and not put all your eggs in one basket. Be diversified and choose great companies as I believe we might see the market going up until the end of the year  as December has been one of the best performing months for the stock market over the time, with stocks seeing the Santa Claus effect almost every year while we also have to wait and see if the FDA approves the Pfizer vaccine on the 10th of December which I believe will be a good catalyst for the market as it has traded sideways. Today we also got news that Regeneron’s antibody cocktail has just received emergency use authorization from the FDA, this is the drug that was administered to Trump and made him have a quick recovery from the illness.

I'm on vacation this week so I thought I would go over the trades I made this morning and my reasoning behind them. Feel free to leave questions or critiques.

&nbsp;

**BABA (-$51.25)**

Ticker has been really bullish the past few days and was on my watchlist in hopes of getting a swing entry on a 4h higher low. It had a 1m EQ form at the start of the day and I went long. I played a smaller than normal position because I wasn't super confident in this one due to expecting 4h consolidation. The decision to go long was largely based upon SPY/QQQ doing bullish things at the open.

**PLTR (+$92.58)**

Ticker has been running super hard the past few weeks. Opened bullish and within striking distance of the ATH. After an nice initial push up I bought what looked like a 2m higher low. In hindsight I took profit on this one way too fast.

[PLTR 2m Higher Low](https://imgur.com/a/uJKqs8i)

**SQ (+$345.38)**

Ticker opened near the previous ATH from 11/6 of $201.33 ($204.09 PM 11/9). I went long with a starter position looking for continuation and added on a 2m higher low. I went long again after QQQ hit a new LOD and SQ did not. I got stopped out but re-entered when QQQ broke to a new LOD and immediately reversed. 

[SQ 2m chart](https://imgur.com/a/fs1CQsk)

[QQQ 2nd trade go signal](https://imgur.com/a/ZzdTHAD)

**SNAP (-95.98)**

Ticker high a new ATH off the open and then formed an EQ. It was holding up much better than QQQ. I went long looking for the EQ to break bullish off of a QQQ 5m oversold bounce taking place.

**ROKU (+$345.19)**

Gapped up to ATH today. After it opened strong I was looking for the 5m/15m to play out as a Bull Flag. I took 2 trades with that in mind. I was watching the 2m chart and based the entries off of green reversal candles, where the 5m EMAs were, and what QQQ was doing on the 2m/5m.

After hitting record levels in the Dow and the S&P, the market consolidated its gain, finishing the day even or slightly red. Ahead of the US Thanksgiving holiday, optimism over a relatively quick rollout of a coronavirus vaccine propelled the Dow Jones to above 30,000 points for the first time and the S&P to record highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has been beaten down recently as market participants rotate to cyclical and reopening stocks also posted a strong week.

Countering the optimism is the reality that the coronavirus pandemic has been surging the last few weeks, raising the specter of further restrictions. As of Tuesday, there 88,080 patients hospitalized with the coronavirus pandemic

Finally, after four painful weeks, the surge in coronavirus infections are showing early signs of improvement. The national weekly average for daily new infections is 172,118, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. While that is an all-time record, it only represents an 11% increase to last week. In the past four weeks, average daily new infections were posting a roughly 30-40% increase every week. The daily average deaths are more than 1,500, similar level to early May.

Today was a slow day, in terms of news. With Thanksgiving coming up, markets are closed tomorrow and open only half-day Friday

The political uncertainty in the United States is beginning to clear up. Weeks after Joe Biden was declared President-Elect, General Service Administration (GSA) head Emily Murphy acknowledged Biden’s win and approved the official transition process. The GSA is a government agency that works largely behind the scenes to support other federal entities, with responsibility for managing federal office space, procuring supplies and improving the use of technology across the government. The GSA provides a presidential transition team with Washington office space and coordinates access to federal agencies to plan potential policy changes with current administration officials, using $6.3 million allocated to support its efforts. This will finally allow Biden’s team to gain access to crucial information needed to effectively govern the nation. Mark Haefele, UBS Global chief investment officer, said, “We believe that the recent reduction in political uncertainty in the U.S., though far from complete, is another supportive factor behind the recent stock rally,

Markets were also encouraged by Biden’s appointment of former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to Treasury  Secretary. Yellen served as Fed Chair from 2014-2018, helping steer the historic bull market that followed the 2008 recession.

Hey everyone Happy Thanksgiving and Welcome! So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. 

As my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)

So i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less > more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.

So here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don’t make this a 2 hour read time.

I will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

The second holding is Apple, is there anybody that doesn’t know this company? They are the biggest company in the world and they continue to expand with new products and services every day, I don’t see this company going down in the short term or the long term as they have pretty expensive at a 35 P/E but earnings are still rising especially with more subscription based income coming in with the release of the Apple One Bundle.

Zoom is the one company that I will be selling in the next couple of days.

So here how I want to make my portfolio look like when I have enough money to open all the positions. [TARGETED PORTFOLIo](https://ibb.co/CHWsb27)

As you can see a quarter of my portfolio will be invested in high quality companies that are pretty safe in my opinion. While over 45% of the portfolio will go to companies that I really like, that have a pretty low risk in my opinion and can offer great returns in the future. While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. 

And finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs. I don’t want to keep money on the sidelines at the moment as I expect the stock market will keep rising for a couple of years at a rapid pace due to the recovery of the economy.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones hit record highs early in the morning before turning steeply negative as stimulus talks in Washington appear to hit a roadblock. 

Today, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke on the Senate floor and accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of “delaying, deflecting and moving the goalposts” during stimulus negotiations. This snuffed out investor confidence that a deal would get done, at least in the near-term. Here at Psycho, we don’t expect the passage of more stimulus until a change in White House administration and control of the Senate is decided. 

Yesterday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin revealed he offered Pelosi a new proposal worth $916 billion. He said his plan “includes money for state and local governments and robust liability protection for businesses, schools, and universities.” Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers had unveiled a stimulus outline worth about $908 billion, which diverged from Mnuchin’s plan on some key issues, including offering $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits absent from Mnuchin’s proposal, according to Yahoo Finance.

Earlier in the week, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released data that reaffirmed that Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech’s (BNTX) vaccine candidate was effective within approximately 10 days after the dose and showed strong protection regardless of age, weight, race, or gender. The FDA is now scheduled to convene its panel of outsider Thursday, with the group expected to vote on the approval of the vaccine.

The United States recorded its second-worst day of infections Tuesday, with another 220,000 infections. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, says the full impact of Thanksgiving gatherings hasn’t been seen yet. He said, “The blip from Thanksgiving isn't even here yet. So we’re getting those staggering numbers of new cases and hospitalizati0ns before we even feel the full brunt of the Thanksgiving holiday”. The US is averaging nearly 200,000 infections and 2,237 deaths in the last seven numbers, the deadliest week in the pandemic since late April, according to Johns Hopkins University. There are well over 100,000 patients hospitalized with coronavirus.

**Highlights** 

* Canada officially approves Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech’s (BNTX) coronavirus vaccine.
* The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a coalition of attorneys general from 48 states and territories filed two separate antitrust lawsuits against Facebook (FB) on Wednesday. The lawsuits target two of Facebook’s major acquisitions, Instagram and WhatsApp, alleging anticompetitive behavior. In response, Facebook General Counsel said, “Antitrust laws exist to protect consumers and promote innovation, not to punish successful businesses. Instagram and WhatsApp became the incredible products they are today because Facebook invested billions of dollars, and years of innovation and expertise, to develop new features and better experiences for the millions who enjoy those products. The most important fact in this case, which the Commission does not mention in its 53-page complaint, is that it cleared these acquisitions years ago. The government now wants a do-over.“
* QuantumScape, the electric battery developer was on fire again today, up around 30% in the day. The stock is up 125% since the merger finalized.
* DoorDash (DASH) shares open for trading at $182, almost double their IPO price of $105. 
* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Wedbush from $150 to $160 OUTPERFORM. 
* Advanced Energy Systems (AEIS) target raised by Rosenblatt Securities from $107 to $120.
* Casey's General Store (CASY) target raised by Deutsche Bank (DB) from $218 to $220 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $180s
* Airbnb is all set to make the IPO tomorrow, Thursday Dec 10. Raising the price in advance, for good measure.
* Chewy (CHWY) with a host of target raises by notable analysts after a good earnings report. Average price target of $85 with OUTPERFORM rating
* Disney (DIS) with a series of target raises. 
   * Loop Capital from $150 to $175
   * Morgan Stanley from $160 to %175
   * Credit Suisse from $146 to $178

Stocks rose today, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) reaching new intraday record highs. Market participants continue to closely monitor ongoing stimulus talks in Washington, distribution of the vaccine, and the coronavirus infection rate. 

On Wednesday, key negotiators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy convened to further discuss a coronavirus stimulus package. The proposal, which is expected to total around $900 billion will likely be attached to the broad government funding bill for the fiscal year, which must be advanced by Friday to avoid a partial government shutdown. The bill includes around $300 billion in aid to businesses; a $300-per-week bonus federal unemployment benefit and renewal of soon-to-expire state benefits; $600 direct payments to individuals; vaccine distribution funds and money for renters, schools, the Postal Service and people needing food aid. McConnell said of the bill, “lawmakers made major headway toward hammering out a targeted pandemic relief” and that “we \[Senators\] have agreed we will not leave town until we’ve made law.” Hopefully, lawmakers are finally able to come together and pass additional and much-needed economic relief.

On Wednesday, the Federal reserve also recommitted to using its full range of monetary policy tools to support the pandemic-stricken economy. The Fed confirmed it would continue the asset purchase program at the current rate “until substantial further progress has been made toward the committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals.” 

Recent economic data shows the toll the latest surge in coronavirus has had on the economy. According to a report released Wednesday, retail sales fell 1.1% in November, the biggest drop in seven months. The Labor Department also released its Weekly Unemployment report, which showed a second straight increase in the number of first-time unemployment claims. 880,000 Americans filed for new unemployment claims, much higher than the 818,000 expected.

Despite the signs of near-term weakness, most analysts expect the pace of economic recovery to increase in 2021 as the vaccine enables the broad reopening of businesses. Kirk Hartman, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo said, “Given all the stimulus, the bond purchases, the maintenance of rates at zero, I think you are going to get a boost in the markets at the beginning of the year. It's hard to argue with these fundamentals here, there's so much money in the system and clearly, the Fed indicated today that it was going to continue.”

Highlights

* FDA advisory committee is meeting to consider granting emergency use authorization for Moderna’s (MRNA) coronavirus vaccine.
* Alphabet's Google (GOOG) won EU antitrust approval on Thursday for its $2.1 billion bid for Fitbit after agreeing on restrictions on how it will use customers' health-related data
* Robinhood has agreed to pay a $65 million fine to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it misled customers. The SEC accused Robinhood of failing to inform customers about payments it received from trading firms to route customer orders through them, a move that resulted in customers paying higher prices to execute trades.
* It seems Netflix (NFLX) is aiming to increase its presence in Africa with the appointment of Zimbabwean billionaire Strive Masiyiwa to its board. Masiyiwa made his fortune through a telecommunication and mobile-payment company called Econet.
* After a meteoric rise this year, chinese electric vehicle maker NIO has a greater market cap than General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). 
* Chewy (CHWY) target raised by Needham & Co. from $90 to $110 BUY. Stock currently around $100.
* Arbutus Biopharma (ABUS) price target set by HC Wainwright at $10 BUY. Stock currently around $4.70, so implying more than 100% upside.
* CareDx (CDNA) target raised by BTIG Research from $55 to $80 at BUY. Stock currently around $67
* ROKU target raised by Bannk of America (BAC) from $360 to $380 BUY. Stock currently around $347 after jumping up after-hours.

kezmih,54,44,wallstreetbets,T - opportunity of a lifetime due to HBO Max,0.88,1608248210.0,1608219410.0,"HBO Max just announced the long awaited deal with Roku last evening, just in time for ROKU owners to be able to sign up for HBO Max and watch WW84. At $15.99 a month and including upcoming movies such as WW84 and Matrix 4 free included simultaneously with the theater release, just on that alone HBO Max is expected to gather TONS of new signups. Not to mention WW84 has been receiving glowing reviews (88% Fresh on rotten tomatoes).

Why did it go DOWN by a dollar today? At the very same time (likely before seeing the Roku announcement), Morgan Stanley downgraded T to equal weight based on cost risks of 5G - not a very compelling argument in my opinion, but you can see here: ([https://www.thestreet.com/investing/att-falls-on-morgan-stanley-downgrade](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/att-falls-on-morgan-stanley-downgrade)). They are not taking into account the unlimited potential of streaming. Look at the price of netflix. Look at the price of Disney which is PURELY driven by disney+. And compare to T. Imaging teh tendies rolling in once they announce their numbers after the holiday season.

You heard it here first (maybe second or third?). T will be rising hard the next few months.

Is today the stimulus deadline? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/Nj34Qdp) leading the way up 0.5% and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/WcwDrN2) also finishing in the green, up 0.18% and ended over the 3700 level for just the 2nd time in history, while the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/Sdvkw4L) lagged and lost 0.15%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/w62QhvW) continuing to drop 1.7%, back to some more normal levels after the recent spike near 25.

Despite the broad market rally [yesterday](https://ibb.co/Z2qpxL2), about 55% of companies were losing ground on average volume, as we saw the Tech and Consumer Discretionary [sectors](https://ibb.co/BftQNpd) leading the way, while the only sector losing more than 1% for the day was the Utilities sector. As only Large-Cap growth [companies](https://ibb.co/cyY67bQ) from the tech sector finished in the green, while small-caps and especially value play lagged behind.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/5LKrKdx) that most of the big tech names, Microsoft, Amazon, NFLX and even Alibaba which has suffered lately finished up well into the green, while the industrials and utilities were a big block of red.

We also got some economic data yesterday, with business [inventories](https://ibb.co/jZndKhQ) rising more than expected as sales increased by 0.9% month over month. We also saw retail [sales](https://ibb.co/XjqJyhW) falling 1.1% in November from the previous month, but this may be misleading, as sales actually rose by more than 4% year over year and by almost 6% after stripping out auto, gas and retail sales. 

We also continue to see the housing demand market being [strong](https://ibb.co/cTT9BjX) as the housing market index was down from the previous month, but came in at the second highest level ever.

One last number that we got was a reading on the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/Mg0pgHq), which came in at 55.7, below expectations and the last month number. This was the lowest reading in three months as growth momentum keeps slowing down as more restrictions are re-imposed, but this is still a strong expansion of the manufacturing and services.

[Today](https://ibb.co/fGq6Bqc) we will get some critical economic data, starting with initial and continuing jobless claims and housing starts, while we will also see get other important numbers later in the day.

So, we also got the AAII [survey](https://ibb.co/ynQhYRg) yesterday, which for me personally, was a good indicator that stocks may still go up, as the bullish number of investors declined by 4.6%, with most of them switching to a neutral view of the stock market. There are still a lot more investors that are bullish compared to the historical average of 38% but, this is an improving in the last weeks, as this is a very good contrarian indicator. When more people tend to be bearish that is usually a good sign that you should just go and buy stocks, as you can mostly buy them at a discount, while when to many people are bullish, there is a significantly bigger risk of a pullback or correction nearing the stock market.

[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/5BwsTzH) we saw the FED keeping rates unchanged and signaling that they will continue to keep a near-zero rate through 2023 to support the economic recovery.

They also announced that the economy is expected to contract by only 2.4% in 2020, that is a big improvement from a contraction of 3.7% previously expected. They also expect the economy to grow by 4.2% next year and by more than 3% in 2022, with both revisions also being up from the previous estimates. They also vowed to keep buying bonds until there is substantial economic progress in the US, so they are expected to continue to buy $120B, with $80B in Treasury securities and another $40B in mortgage-backed securities.

Other revisions in the projected economic data also showed an improved outlook in the unemployment rate, which is expected to drop to 3.7% by 2023.

The FED Chief Powell also reinforced the commitment to aid the economy with even more easing if it deems it necessary while also suggesting they will give ample warning before tapering bond purchases.

This was happening while the congress was still haggling over details on a bigger $900B relief [BILL](https://ibb.co/PQBrH2Y). We also saw a major change from the last day as now it is expected that it will include a 600$ stimulus check and extended unemployment benefits. I think this must be agreed on as soon as today if it stands a chance of passing by the end of the week, even if Congress leaders have repeatedly told they will remain in session as long as needed, even working through the weekend, they should just put their act together and pass the stuff they can agree on so that uncertainty goes away, at least for the moment.

We also have some interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/vHCS87T) reports coming today with FedEx, BlackBerry and General Mills.

[FedEx](https://ibb.co/D89m06D) is expected to post an EPS of over 4$, that would be up almost 60% over last year with an operating Margin of 7.1%. FedEx has also just received an upgrade from Credit Suisse based on accelerating e-commerce trends with a longer and stronger holiday season than expected.

[JABIL](https://ibb.co/tL2qNRb) just reported while writing this post a nice surprise due to the high demand in the new Apple lineup, with a beat of 34 cents on earnings and almost $800M on revenues. The stock skyrocketed after the release.

We also got [Lennar](https://ibb.co/f9pLZxP) earnings after the close yesterday, as they beat the estimates easily, while also offering better numbers in new orders and guidance. As they expect more than 62K deliveries and 24% gross margins in FY 2021, that is up from 53K and a 20.6% gross margin in FY2020, this pushed the stock up 3% in after hours, in an unexpected move to the upside for me, despite my expectations for a great quarter for the company.

In other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/C82FmBg), we saw Roku gaining more than 5% in after-hours, after they finally reached an agreement with Warner Media to make HBO Max available directly to their streaming business.

Meanwhile, gambling seems to be getting a boost every other day, as the most [recent](https://ibb.co/YhtQJH9) comment from Cuomo, made investors feel like gambling could become a big source of income for the state of New York. This boosted companies like DraftKings and Penn Gaming even more, as gambling is coming faster than expected in the entire country. [DraftKings](https://ibb.co/1QdMW97) also managed to strike a deal to launch a brand-new retail gift card just in time for the holiday season. This will be available in multiple convenience stores and is a good way for DraftKings to attract even more users to their platform in my opinion.

We Also saw [companies](https://ibb.co/yVS3v1H) lose ground yesterday like Fiverr which dropped in early trading before recovering to finish -2% for the day, after a report that Facebook is eyeing an entry into the gig business, this would be a major competitor that could eat up a lot of growth that Fiverr expected

Let’s hope for another great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/1zf63r8) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

In other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/C82FmBg), we saw Roku gaining more than 5% in after-hours, after they finally reached an agreement with Warner Media to make HBO Max available directly to their streaming business.

Meanwhile, gambling seems to be getting a boost every other day, as the most [recent](https://ibb.co/YhtQJH9) comment from Cuomo, made investors feel like gambling could become a big source of income for the state of New York. This boosted companies like DraftKings and Penn Gaming even more, as gambling is coming faster than expected in the entire country. [DraftKings](https://ibb.co/1QdMW97) also managed to strike a deal to launch a brand-new retail gift card just in time for the holiday season. This will be available in multiple convenience stores and is a good way for DraftKings to attract even more users to their platform in my opinion.

We Also saw [companies](https://ibb.co/yVS3v1H) lose ground yesterday like Fiverr which dropped in early trading before recovering to finish -2% for the day, after a report that Facebook is eyeing an entry into the gig business, this would be a major competitor that could eat up a lot of growth that Fiverr expected

Let’s hope for another great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/1zf63r8) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

kfmlvf,47,14,stocks,FUBOTV Stock - signs of an irrational bull market #FUBOTV #FUBO,0.89,1608332323.0,1608303523.0,"Ok everyone. Challenge me here. FUBO goes public at $10, now trades near $40 after another analyst comes out with a bullish report and a $50 px target. What gives? Is this another sign of an irrational buyers market? Like Nikola going up because people love anything to do with EV. Seems everyone loves that FUBO is streaming and see it akin to Netflix. Let me set some facts here:

1. People keep talking about their revenue and not profit because its a tech company. Doesn't mean ignore profit! They burned well over $100m last year and there is no end in sight to the bleeding. What then after they burn all their IPO money? Another dilutive offering?

2.They are not Netflix. They are a vMVPD. That is a CABLE TV company that provides their service via streaming ala AT&T TV, Philo, Sling, Hulu Live, and the now defunct PS Vue. They are not Roku, they are not Netflix. And where has this industry gone? NOWHERE. The sub counts for these services still meander in low single digit millions. They keep raising prices bc they have the same issues as traditional cable. It's expensive to bundle traditional TV content, and traditional content is declining in viewership.

3. Fundamentals are a wreck. Burn $100m plus a year. Only had $9m in cash pre-IPO (that's insane for a company to have only $9m in the bank...seriously talk about liquidity risk). They've raised a ton of VC rounds, but frankly they seem to just be spent on keeping afloat with a measley 500k subs. They took out a PPP loan (red flag). And the most troubling is their margins are challenged. Why? Bc they're cable TV! Their gross margin  is flat (look at their S-1) because TV content is expensive. For every customer that pays say $50 in subscription Fubo pays about $50 to the programmers. It's not a fixed cost. And they spend probably $50 in marketing to acquire that sub. Now bake in all the fixed overhead of keeping the lights on and the tech platform....explain to me how they turn a profit? Advertising? Not enough. Sports gambling? You're still a cable TV company. Show me. The only way is to continue price increases just as they have been and every cable TV company has, and you know where that is headed...

4. And in closing. Let's see, Sling's sub numbers have been flattish now. AT&T TV NOW is declining. YouTube TV is the only one meaningfully growing but they also are owned by a company with deep pockets (hello Google) and losing money on a live TV experiment with the end goal of empowering their overall ad business is a drop in the bucket for them. Remember PS Vue? They had a decent number of subs. They shut down because...well cable TV is not profitable and they threw in the towel. You have to compare FuboTV to these guys. That's their comp base. Don't compare them to Roku and Netflix. I don't understand where people come off thinking they will skyrocket. Why because like Disney+ and NFLX they're going to get millions and millions of subscribers? People are canceling cable, not adding cable....FuboTV is...cable...

But hey stock's up, great. Make some quick cash and get out. Leave the burn to the hedge funds and institutions. But to me this one is a strong pass.",2020-12-18

These are the companies he bought. So you can judge whether or not they're mostly long term  (\~5-10 year holds), or pump and dump stocks. I'm not subscribed to MF myself.

 So Netflix's market cap is 227 billion vs At&t which is 204 billion, Hbo max which is brand new only has 6% the amount of users compared to Netflix so it has a shit load of growth potential. 

Also on an anecdotal note most people I know either have an HBO max account or are talking about getting one.

We also all seen how much Disney has shot up do to Disney Plus (which has 86 million users, but has been out for 13 months compared to HBO max which only been out for 7 months, also it's twice as expensive as disney plus).

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning!

First of all, I wanted to wish everyone a happy new year and hopefully things get better in 2021, and this also brings us at least the great returns that we had in 2020 in the stock market!

So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finish the last full trading day of the year in the green, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/0cvjjHN) leading the way, up .24% and closing at a new record high, while both the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QFyd2f6) and the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/B67fT1g) were up just over .1% for the day.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/b6Nqf9Z) barely drop yesterday closing just below 23, and with the Georgia runoff election just days away, we can see this going higher if the Democrats win both seats.

We saw almost 70% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g9CHK9Q) with most of them trading way below average volume as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/LzXDF2P) finished in the green, with Energy & Materials closing the day up more than 1.3% while the biggest loser was the Communications sector, falling almost 0.7%, as we saw the small-cap stocks regain some momentum, [leading](https://ibb.co/yQCFtTZ) the way after they had 2 very bad days to start the week, while the only group that was losing ground yesterday was the large-cap growth sector.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/x5bN7Lk) from yesterday that pretty much sums up the other charts as we can see most big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and even Apple losing ground for the day, while the biggest gainers were companies like Tesla & TSM alongside the industrial sector and companies like Disney and Mastercard.

Yesterday we also got the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/7QPXjPV), which for me personally came in pretty mixed, as I use this as a contrarian indicator. This last week we saw 2.5% more investors moving to the bull’s camp, while we also saw almost a 5% increase in bears, as investors become more divided. I think the market is still a little to over bullish and I would avoid to add more money right now, but I wouldn’t get of the stock market either. I think this is a good moment to stay put and wait for more developments overall, but there might still be some good opportunities around in the market and I wouldn’t avoid getting into those.

We also got a lot of economic data yesterday, with a survey for business uncertainty for [December](https://ibb.co/87FMyQ6) showing increasing uncertainty for sales growth but a with a small decline in employment growth expectations.

Meanwhile another number that confirms the investor sentiment survey is the Investor Confidence [Index](https://ibb.co/5952C9Z) which rose by more than 13 points in November, as investors increased the risk appetite for their portfolios.

Alongside this we also saw the November pending home [SALES](https://ibb.co/F8WBXnh) decrease by more than 2.5% month over month, but are still up more than 16% since a year ago, with this monthly decrease mostly coming due to the shortage of inventory.

The Chicago [PMI](https://ibb.co/QF40My3) also came in way better than expected and 59.5 vs 57 expected and up from the 58.2 in the previous month with the biggest movement coming from the employment indicator as it rose to a one year high but is still in contraction territory since 2019.

We also saw the wholesale [inventories](https://ibb.co/fkWmNmc) decrease in November’s advance read while the [retail](https://ibb.co/BBKNrb5) inventories saw an increase of .7%, pretty much in-line with expectations while the trade [balance](https://ibb.co/CKSR070) also saw a surprise decline in the deficit to more than of $84B, $4B worse than the last revision.

[Today](https://ibb.co/D14JGZc) we get initial and continuing jobless claims numbers, alongside the money supply and the FED Balance sheet to end us off for the year.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/GkZgGM1), we saw Fubo sink more than 14% again yesterday after another investing firm announced they have shorted the stock, pointing to the insane valuations of more than $13.000/subscriber.

We also saw a [research](https://ibb.co/QMF5fnG) that indicated some changes in the market share of car companies with Hyundai/Kia having the biggest gains alongside GM, while Nissan saw the biggest decline in market share, mostly due to selling larger & pricier SUVs with cars continuing to see a decline in sales, while the larger vehicles have started to rebound slightly, as all car makers are [bringing](https://ibb.co/kJGkXtz) more & more SUVs and Trucks to the market.

Lockheed Martin also was [awarded](https://ibb.co/bWS5G6j) a new Navy contract worth more than $900M as this might help the company start to get back on track while Mexico will become the world largest legal cannabis market as the Mexican Senate passed a bill in November which is [expected](https://ibb.co/VW3Lqtn) to receive approval in the lower house by February. This is great news for companies in the sector like ACB, Canopy Growth and the future merged company Tilray & Aphria.

Also, one of the biggest active ETFs with over $15B in assets, the [ARK](https://ibb.co/80WJFdW) Innovation ETF saw it’s first daily withdrawal since November, as this hasn’t experienced weekly outflows since early in 2020, this might have been driven by profit taking as this ETF has surged more than 140% this year and also just the ex-dividend date on the 29th, as people expect for the ETF to have a hard time in duplicating the results of this year, which saw it rise on the back of Tesla and Roku with both of them seeing massive increases, with Tesla having more than 7x-ing this year, as that is the biggest holding in the ETF, but who knows we have to wait and see as [TESLA](https://ibb.co/ZzGQgqX) may hit 500K deliveries this year.

And one last piece of [news](https://ibb.co/9bQhB4B) is that Apple did a big purge in their App Store, removing almost 40K game apps as this was the deadline for the developers to submit a government issued license number that enabled users to make in-app purchases. I don’t really think this will have a major impact for the revenues but we will soon find out.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mvv7tjX) seem to be pointing at a mixed open, with the Nasdaq and the SP500 pointing at a good open while the Dow is slightly down, and with no connection to this, in the UK, the [BREXIT](https://ibb.co/Rh1DYyG) chapter is finally about to close.

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning!

First of all, I wanted to wish everyone a happy new year and hopefully things get better in 2021, and this also brings us at least the great returns that we had in 2020 in the stock market!

So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finish the last full trading day of the year in the green, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/0cvjjHN) leading the way, up .24% and closing at a new record high, while both the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QFyd2f6) and the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/B67fT1g) were up just over .1% for the day.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/b6Nqf9Z) barely drop yesterday closing just below 23, and with the Georgia runoff election just days away, we can see this going higher if the Democrats win both seats.

We saw almost 70% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g9CHK9Q) with most of them trading way below average volume as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/LzXDF2P) finished in the green, with Energy & Materials closing the day up more than 1.3% while the biggest loser was the Communications sector, falling almost 0.7%, as we saw the small-cap stocks regain some momentum, [leading](https://ibb.co/yQCFtTZ) the way after they had 2 very bad days to start the week, while the only group that was losing ground yesterday was the large-cap growth sector.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/x5bN7Lk) from yesterday that pretty much sums up the other charts as we can see most big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and even Apple losing ground for the day, while the biggest gainers were companies like Tesla & TSM alongside the industrial sector and companies like Disney and Mastercard.

Yesterday we also got the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/7QPXjPV), which for me personally came in pretty mixed, as I use this as a contrarian indicator. This last week we saw 2.5% more investors moving to the bull’s camp, while we also saw almost a 5% increase in bears, as investors become more divided. I think the market is still a little to over bullish and I would avoid to add more money right now, but I wouldn’t get of the stock market either. I think this is a good moment to stay put and wait for more developments overall, but there might still be some good opportunities around in the market and I wouldn’t avoid getting into those.

We also got a lot of economic data yesterday, with a survey for business uncertainty for [December](https://ibb.co/87FMyQ6) showing increasing uncertainty for sales growth but a with a small decline in employment growth expectations.

Meanwhile another number that confirms the investor sentiment survey is the Investor Confidence [Index](https://ibb.co/5952C9Z) which rose by more than 13 points in November, as investors increased the risk appetite for their portfolios.

Alongside this we also saw the November pending home [SALES](https://ibb.co/F8WBXnh) decrease by more than 2.5% month over month, but are still up more than 16% since a year ago, with this monthly decrease mostly coming due to the shortage of inventory.

The Chicago [PMI](https://ibb.co/QF40My3) also came in way better than expected and 59.5 vs 57 expected and up from the 58.2 in the previous month with the biggest movement coming from the employment indicator as it rose to a one year high but is still in contraction territory since 2019.

We also saw the wholesale [inventories](https://ibb.co/fkWmNmc) decrease in November’s advance read while the [retail](https://ibb.co/BBKNrb5) inventories saw an increase of .7%, pretty much in-line with expectations while the trade [balance](https://ibb.co/CKSR070) also saw a surprise decline in the deficit to more than of $84B, $4B worse than the last revision.

[Today](https://ibb.co/D14JGZc) we get initial and continuing jobless claims numbers, alongside the money supply and the FED Balance sheet to end us off for the year.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/GkZgGM1), we saw Fubo sink more than 14% again yesterday after another investing firm announced they have shorted the stock, pointing to the insane valuations of more than $13.000/subscriber.

**""Okay, but where do I start?""**

*I was asking myself this same question only 10 months ago. So, do not automatically assume that you are laps behind. For the past ten years, I focused on just allocating a portion of each paycheck towards my retirement account. I focused on keeping it simple and stuck to low-cost index funds. Mostly, because I am unable to invest in individual stocks in my government retirement account. With that said, low-cost index funds are the most assured way to secure a nice retirement. The only thing you need is a few decades of continued contributions and growth. I found myself wanting something else though. I did not want to wait to retire in my sixties.*

*This is where I shifted my goals a bit. I wanted to focus on building up an investment portfolio, which I could access at any time. I opened a brokerage account so I could eventually live off it, much like my 401K, but could start relying on 20 years earlier. I still contribute to my 401k, but the goal is to not need it.*

**Road Map:** 

*You must be ready to change your beliefs. There are endless of ways to invest and many of those ways can be the right way.* 

**How I currently see my investment road map is this:**

*Next 12 years invest in companies that:*

&#x200B;

* *Small to medium market cap*
* *Very high growth*
* *Software as a Service modeled company*

*From years 12-15 transition in companies that:*

&#x200B;

* *Medium to large market cap*
* *Dividend companies or,*
* *High growth*

This map could easily change, based on too many factors to count. Instead of the next 12 years, I could keep my approach now well into the future. I could end up being burned by one too many companies and grow to be more conservative. You just must be willing to adapt.

***Philosophy:***

**How many companies?**

*There is no golden rule I follow when it comes to the number of companies, I hold at one point in time. I try to stick somewhere between 15-25, because it is easier for me to really keep up with these companies from top to bottom at this amount.*

**Ideal market cap?**

*Less than 25 Billion is where I would like to be for each holding. Typically, I focus on companies in the single-digit billions, but if a company continues to grow at a high rate, I stay in my position until the revenue growth declines by a reasonable amount.*

**What type of companies?**

C*loud based subscription modeled companies. This means that the company is usually a SaaS one. Software as a Service (SaaS). They offer small, medium, large, and enterprise customers certain services on a subscription model. The stickier the service the better. If the type of service is one that becomes hard to live without, the company can sell additional add-ons and improvements to the company. The subscriptions are usually done annual, so it is easy to see revenue floor of the companies. So, the growth would be accelerated by the additional new customers that are brought in.*

*I also do not mind e-commerce companies (Shopify, Etsy, Pinterest, etc.) and sometimes a bio tech company here and there.*

How long do I hold a company?

*It is quite flexible, but If I see two consecutive quarters of growth declined earnings… I put my money to work in a better vehicle.*

**Building the portfolio:** 

*I originally started with 10 companies and made them all 10% each of my portfolio. I felt that it was straight forward and that the cream would rise to the top and make up a larger percentage of my holdings. My beginning balance was no great amount, either.*   
 *The companies were:*

1. The Trade Desk

2. Etsy

3. Datadog

4. Fastly

5. Alteryx

6. Crowdstrike

7. Roku

8. Appian

9. Elastic

10. Zoom

*I still own all of these companies, aside from Alteryx. I put very little more into any of these companies. I want to make the company do the hard work. I want their performance to grow my account… not more of my own money. I only add more money to accounts when I see a large collapse of share price for no fault of the company (Covid).*

**New companies?**

*For new companies, I limit the size of the position to 1-3% of my portfolio’s current size. Overtime they will grow and be worth more than that percentage of my portfolio and if not, the risk was minimized, and I move on. I do not focus on share price because these are typically small cap companies with large runways and just because something is 900 dollars a share, does not mean it cannot hit 3000 dollars a share.*

**How year 1 ended?**

Above is my portfolio from my first year with this strategy. 

I am currently holding **17** companies with just have added MGNI on the 31st of December. 

I will probably add 3 more companies and sit at 20 for this year.

Is Lemonade overvalued? FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb) finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but it’s still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.

We just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate & Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  
We also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursday’s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil & Gas industry.

Here is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.

We also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.

The biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn’t safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.

We also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM) in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton & Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple & Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney & Salesforce.

We also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau’s gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.

Meanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).

While this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data don’t show up as investors & analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.

We also really don’t get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens & Bed Bath & Beyond coming on Thursday.

So, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc) pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world’s biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock, check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/kcjd36/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).

Some other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December, while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.

Meanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.

Guys, personally I can’t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China. You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/kmoxky/apple_aapl_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/)

We also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA’s CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.

Meanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.

And on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Roku’s exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.

We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.

Meanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.

Guys, personally I can’t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China.

We also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA’s CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.

Meanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.

And on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Roku’s exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.

Is Lemonade overvalued? FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb)  finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but it’s still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.

We just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate & Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  
We also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursday’s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil & Gas industry.

Here is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.

We also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.

The biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn’t safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.

We also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM)  in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton & Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple & Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney & Salesforce.

We also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau’s gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.

Meanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).

While this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data don’t show up as investors & analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.

We also really don’t get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens & Bed Bath & Beyond coming on Thursday.

So, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc)  pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world’s biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US.

DOW got further lifted by action from BA, GS, CVX, and INTC (who's really only being carried by MU). Small caps eclipsed SPX and IXIC today with RUT/IWM up as high as almost 2% during intraday high as value play starts looking more appealing. RUT closed up 1.7% and IWM closed up 1.61%.

* ""I'm totes not dead."" Says Jack Ma, according to a person familiar with the situation who's relaying the info to a CNBC  reporter on Ma's whereabouts. The beleaguered CEO who's in the crosshair of the CCP is keeping it easy and out of the limelight after running afoul of his overlords by talking up CCP's heavy handed action towards Ant Group. Who knew if your fucking financial empire touches the livelihood of 90% of the country there may be consequences if you don't toe the line. BABA closed the day up 5.51% to $240. Meanwhile, PDD touches new ATH and closed the day up 12.24% to $187 while JD is up 10.61% to $95.

* Many underlying in the Chinese ADR/ADS sector also gets a lift today partly thanks to NYSE's overnight about-face on delisting Chinese Telecoms. BILI hits new ATH and closed up 8.15% to $102.46 thanks to favorable reception from their secondary listing on the Heng Sheng while TCEHY closed the day up 5.23% to $76.66.

* Semi sector is on a run today thanks to MU, with Citi upping the NAND and DRAM manufacturer from Sell all the way up to Buy with a PT of freaking $100 as we enter another cyclical season. RBC Capital also raised PT from $57 to $83, Deutsche Bank from $75 to $83. Will MU $90 be back in favor and no longer a meme strike? Find out later this week. F in the chat for MartyMoho. If only he bought fooking shares and ride through two more additional cyclical season and a global pandemic. Ez dub. MU closed up 4.33% to $77, LRCX closed up 3.46% to $494, and AMAT closed up 3% to $89. MU reports earnings later this Thursday after market close.

* GM popped 2% when news broke at 10:29 on positive US sales number from Q4, and while shares were fading slightly as the market digest the news, eventually the positive momentum took over and shares closed the day up 2.84% to $41.66. ROKU pop to close up 5.44%, closing at $335 thanks to WFC analyst raising PT from $275 to $414 (yep) and keeping his overweight rating. 

* Today's big movers: FUBO was up as high as 21%, ~~M-A-R-A was up as high 23% while B-N-G-O drilled more than -30% during intraday lows after an initial halt in the early mornings.~~ FUBO closed up 12.83% to $27.35, ~~M-A-R-A closed up 23.43% to $13.59, and B-N-G-O closed down -31.25% to $4.95~~.

* The GA run-off election is on the market mindset as voters are heading to the polls. Meanwhile, Congress is set to confirm Biden's win over Trump, a procedural formality that generally receives little news coverage but not in the current timeline. Expect POTUS to rage over Pence on Twitter later tonight if the latter confirms Biden's Electoral College win. Look to weed and clean energy sector for pops if the Dems somehow wins both seat. No doubt many WSBer have already loaded up on FDs to showcase the sick gains porn tomorrow if the magic happens.

* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR is up more than 5% but those with OTM Jan 15 calls are likely having their ass handed to them by the greeks, while a similar story exist over at GME as the stock fades away morning gain to close the day up 0.70% as theta rampage $20c, $22c, and $23c (if your strike is even further out then RIP to you). MT and steel gang are faring better, with the stock retaking yesterday's high and closed up 2.84% to 24.63. Steel prices continues to rip and earnings will be early next month on Feb 11th.

* Affirm, the online installment loan lender for Americans who can't fucking afford whatever they're buying, is planning to IPO by offering 24 mil shares at $33 to $38 per share. With a market value of $9 bil, AFRM is sure to be a new meme stock in the coming days.

* The DOW closed up 167 pts to 0.55%, Nasdaq up 120 pts to 0.95%, S&P up 26 pts to 0.71%, and RUT closed up 33 pts to 1.71%. Notable numbers tomorrow: ADP employment report at 8:15 AM ET, factory orders at 10 AM ET, EIA draw at 10:30 AM, and FOMC minutes at 2PM ET.

I’m very interested in this one. For those of you that aren’t familiar, it is an ETF with stakes of next gen tech companies, including 2.27% of ROKU. It was listed on Robinhood on October 13 at $26.79. It steadily dropped to a low of $24.67 on October 30. Until about December 22, we’ve had pretty steady growth. We’ve had short term correction and I think we’re entering another phase of steady growth.
In other words, the ETF is behaving how ETF oughta act. 
Here’s the cool part. The stock is currently sitting at Ab 31. A 35 dollar Call FOR JUNE 18 is priced at 1.08. That’s not it. It has an open interest of 22k and delta of .30.

Well, look no further than QQQJ, an ETF which tracks the NASDAQ Next Gen 100 Index (the next 100 NASDAQ companies after the ones in QQQ). 🚀🚀🚀

As expectations for an economic recovery increase due to the incoming Biden administration, we should see continued growth in the stocks that comprise QQQJ, more so than the large-caps that comprise QQQ. This evidence can be seen by backtesting data provided on the NASDAQ website, which compares the performance of QQQJ against other mid-cap fund performance.

Some of its more well-known holdings include recently beat-down companies such as:

* ROKU (down 5% from December highs)
* TTD (down 20% from December highs)
* BYND (down 18% from December highs)
* DKNG (down 10% from December highs)

Despite this beatdown of its more famous holdings, it's still almost back to pre-December crash highs. More importantly, the premiums on its calls are still lower compared to other similarly priced ETFs.

The incoming volatility from the swearing in of a new president should also cause an IV spike.

But won't growth be limited because companies will move into QQQ as soon as they grow? Not necessarily - in a bull market, all stonks go up, including those in QQQ. If all stonks are going up, then everyone wins, but QQQJ wins more.

# More confirmation bias:

Below is some historic data showing what happens when we have a Democratic president and a split or Republican-led Congress. Combine this with the Roaring Twenties, vaccine hopes, stimulus hopes, economic recovery hopes, and super hot growth potential in healthcare, tech, IT etc, and QQQJ rocket confirmed.

https://preview.redd.it/lmn6ix83yw961.png?width=789&format=png&auto=webp&s=f278c0d3f7bf60b2676dda3f7421e703c7aedee0

# Charts

I've done some rudimentary crayon analysis on Tradingview, and as you all can see, we should see QQQJ at 35 sometime around March. This is based on the most bearish analysis I could find based on its current trend and macroeconomic conditions. As you can see, it's shown relatively stable growth thus far (aside from the crash in December).

Alternatively, we could see hyper growth as the stocks in the Next Gen 100 Index rally based on an optimistic outlook from the potential redo of the Roaring Twenties, vaccine hopes, stimulus hopes, economic recovery hopes, and super hot growth potential in healthcare, tech, IT etc. Below is my best bull-case TA drawing:

# HERE'S THE KEY POINT

Some of QQQJ's holdings recently suffered major beatdowns and are poised for recovery.

Premiums are higher than they were two weeks ago but still undervalued compared to similarly priced ETFs. June 35cs are going for $1.10 right now.

Based on my ~~astrology~~ TA predictions, these should be ITM by March/April, at which time you can either sell the calls or just exercise them and sell the shares.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which shows how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Financials, Green Energy & [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new & improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.

Yesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.

In some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.

While in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business.

[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.

In some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.

So, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, & SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.

We also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.

We also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney & Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.

And on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would greatly benefit them.

[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs & EVs.

On the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba & Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continued to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.

My opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn’t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way,  though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished lower and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn’t base your investment on this.

The drop was caused by two things: lockup period expired which tripled the float and short sellers were coming out as evidenced by the short sale reports.  

Today the insiders who wanted to sell have sold.  Institutions have increased their positions.  And there’s still a ton of short sellers that have to cover.  

A few days ago Fubo released preliminary results https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/fubotv-preliminary-q4-results-indicate-it-will-top/

They are posting huge growth well past their previous estimates.  Marketcap today is under $2B.  This is a netflix/roku type of play at the beginning.  Market is paying a premium for growth (see all EV stocks, weed stocks, etc).  Fubo has the growth and with their niche of live sports they could become involved in a bidding war if some of the major players want to add a new niche to their programming ( I’m looking at you nflx and AMZN ).  But that’s neither here nor there because I think the stock found its floor, the oversupply caused by lockup expiration and high short sales volume has dried up, and between institutions buying in and retail wanting to get in on the next netflix type of play I see this climbing back to $50 very soon.  

This also has meme potential which we all know can turn a ramen eater into a filet mug on feaster.

The Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.

The top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.

#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)

The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn’t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.

The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.

#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)

Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker “CRM”). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.

However, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.

#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)

Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.

Array is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.

#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck & Co. (MRK).

Vertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.

Already +20% today after spending few weeks at the bottom. 
They have a unique position in the MVDP market because their strength is livesports streaming and their current focus on integrating sportsbetting onto the existing platform just makes so much sense.

Qualitative Highlights:
- Team: CEO David Gandler (https://www.google.ca/search?q=david+gandler) has underpromised and overdelivered every step of the way. His technical co-founder made the best in class tech. Power. Couple. 
- Tech: a good start and some acquisition with deals in the pipeline (https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Accelerates-Development-of-Sportsbook/default.aspx) and connections (https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2020/fuboTV-Acquires-Balto-Sports-as-First-Step-Into-Online-Sports-Wagering-Market/default.aspx

- Market: live TV with a sports slant is getting bigger. Sports Igaming/wagering makes that look small. It’s also growing faster. 
- Bonus 1: Beth kindig—who called ROKU early, among others—has FUBO as her top pick. 
- Bonus 2: ~40% of the float short makes it so short squeezy it’s almost NSFW.

Then you just wait for it to drop again and buy 100 shares again or find a new stock to do the same with. If it doesn’t go up 4 bucks then you just keep your shares and you don’t lose anything”.

Big tech such as FB and GOOGL closed up 3.9% and 3.3%, while MSFT closed up almost 1.8%. Conversely, select sectors were punished today as a rotation of sort occurred. Retail/consumer storefront took a beating with WMT down -0.86%, COST down -2.12%, TGT down -3.41%, DG down -2.54%, and BBY down -2.11%.

* It's another spectacular pump day for WSB cult gang as a new religion is formed where GME is the deliverance and the Moon (or Mars?) is the promised land. From fractional shares to irresponsible six figure plays near the recent top, the GME hype is so overwhelming that even WSB has quarantined them into a specific thread. GME opened at a strong 15%+ and went as high as 25%+ intraday to $45.52 but a tweet by Andrew ""tool bag"" Left of Citron at 9:58 AM derailed the party and sent shares under $37 before the bull run continued. Shares of GME closed $39.36, up 10.87% as shorts continue to be squeezed, though the momentum has clearly be snapped a bit.

* Over at BB land, shares of BlackBerry Ltd. pumped another 25% as the market continues to shift the company's valuation as the Canadian company chugs on with their focus on enterprise security software/service. BB closed up 25.51% to $12.35. 

* NFLX reported stellar numbers as sub count tops 200 mil. New net sub numbered in 8.5 mil, an uptick of 2.2 mil from the previous quarter and beats previous projection of 6 mil by 2.5 mil. NFLX sees Q1 additions of 6 mil. While Q4 EPS was $1.19 vs $1.39, NFLX sees Q1 EPS of $2.97 vs consensus of $2.10, further propelling the stock. Implied move was about 8% for weeklies so for those who YOLO'ed you're gucci as long as you didn't buy some retardedly OTM strike. NFLX is up 12.5% as of writing in AH to $564. DIS is up 2% AH and ROKU is up about 1.6%.

* GM pumped more than 9% today on news of MSFT 2 bil investment in GM's self-driving startup Cruise, valuing the side hustle at 30 bil. The boomer stock has low-key been killing it in the past few years and as Model 3 replaces the entry-level 3 series and C class in various neighborhoods, you'll likely see GM EVs replacing various Hondas and Toyotas in the coming years as well. GM closed up 9.75% to $54.84.

* Bank/financial earnings continues with BAC and GS reporting this morning. Both reported strong quarters tho the run-up may have been a bit too much as both underlyings faced the same sell-off pressure their sector faced last Thursday. BAC authorized a 2.9 bil repurchase plan, shares closed the day down slightly -0.73% to $32.77 while GS closed -2.26% to $294.

* Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urges Biden to act big to further help the rona punished economy, but also made some notes on raising corporate rates eventually (once the US overcomes rona). With Yellen set to replace Mnunchin, those who enjoyed Mnunchin's various stimulus phone tag with Pelosi will no doubt miss the ""stimulus talks are going well"" pumps.

* Shares of home builders reacted favorably to Biden's $15,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit proposal, though it will likely face an uphill battle in Congress given the various scope and size of the overall stimulus package. LEN is up 2%, DHI up 2.8%, PHM up 3%, NVR up 3.74%, and KBH up 5.5%.

* In WSB meme stock land not named GME and BB, ICLN closed up 2.75% as the cleantech pump resumes, while MT took a beating of -4% to closed at $22.96, despite a slight PT raise of .5 Euro by Morgan Stanley. Surely metal gang won't be another tanker gang situation.

* In recent IPO land, DASH is up 6.20% to $198 (yeah this 60 bil market cap makes tote sense), AFRM is down -5.14% to $110, AI pulled back -5.46% to $126, and ABNB closed up 2.61% to $173.

* The DOW closed up 0.38% or 116 pts, Nasdaq up a strong 1.53% or 198 pts, SPX up 0.81% or 30 pts, and RUT is up 1.32% or almost 28 pts.

* Notable ERs and numbers later this week: UAL, DFS after market close on Wednesday and INTC on Thursday after market close. Housing market index on Wednesday morning at 10 AM ET, jobless claims at 8:30 AM on Thursday, and on Friday PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.

Netflix crushes earnings while Jack Ma finally appears. General Motors partners with Microsoft to develop their self-driving tech. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last 2 days, as Tuesday we saw the stock market rally with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/bR7cJ13) gaining over 1.5%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/fXZYKRS) rising by .81% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/yhDLD82) Industrial gaining 116 points to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kJPWrR3) dropped over 4.5%.

Over 60% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/BT7vfL0) were advancing with over 200 new highs on above average volume as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/M7wNJ2Q) finished in the green with Energy, Communications & Technology leading the way while Real Estate was the biggest laggard, as growth companies were [outperforming](https://ibb.co/zbgJRWC) with small-caps gaining more than 1%, while Large-Cap Value was the biggest underperformer.

[HERE](https://ibb.co/Dbb47Jn) is the HEAT MAP from Tuesday, as you can see most big tech companies were gaining with Google, Facebook & Alibaba posting a gain of more than 3% while the biggest laggard was the consumer defensive sector.

Yesterday we also saw the broad stock market finish with all 3 major indexes at all time highs as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/s3D1kvZ) lead the way, up almost 2%, while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9hV9fhV) gained 1.36% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/5B3r1D5) rose 257 points as we saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/P9mtRCH) dropping more than 7% after the removal of this big political event.

We didn’t see that many companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/zZzFY6b), with only 57% of them gaining on average volume though 10 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/cTszSd6) finished in the green with Communications leading the way after a huge spike in Netflix, while the Financial sector was the only one to lose ground as Large-Cap Growth companies [outperformed](https://ibb.co/8mVHFyx) the rest of the market, with Large-Cap value play finishing the day down almost 1%.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/LvGDryV) from yesterday with all big tech names gaining over 2%, as Amazon, Google & Netflix all gained more than 4% while the biggest laggards were seen in the banking & biotech sectors.

We didn’t get to much economic data in the past days, with the most interesting one being the Redbook store [sales](https://ibb.co/zPDB0pj) which improved slightly over last week, as the economic calendar was on pause, awaiting the inauguration of the new US president.

[Today](https://ibb.co/jgJ1frz) we start getting more economic data, as we start off with Jobless Claims early in the morning and close with the Money supply and the FED’s balance sheet. We have to see if last week was just a blip or if the jobless claims will continue to rise even more.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Netflix](https://ibb.co/54tB18g) miss the earnings/share but beating both the revenue, and especially the net adds of subscribers, which came in at 8.5M vs the 6M expected as the biggest streaming platform has passed 200M subscribers. Netflix spiked [yesterday](https://ibb.co/B6zTrSp) more than 16% and closed at an all-time high as they have hinted at a sustainable free cash flow after 2021, as the company will no longer seek to raise debt and is expecting to start stock buybacks in the next years, which will be a great positive for shareholders. Another benefit is their pricing [power](https://ibb.co/s93DdWz) , as they have just increased their most popular subscription plan by 1$ and they can do this even further with minimum risk of losing to much of the subscriber base. I really like 3 companies in this sector (Netflix, Disney & Roku) and I think you should own all 3 of them as this is the future, while the old TV and cinema world is dying.

We also saw [GM](https://ibb.co/hyb3GSB) rising after entering a new strategic relationship with Microsoft. This looks like a nice partnership between the two, with GM using Microsoft’s cloud computing to develop their Cruise venture, which is a subsidiary of GM. And on the other hand, this deal will provide needed capital to Cruise to fast-track their self-driving tech while also making Microsoft, GM’s preferred public cloud partner. I think GM is a very good play on the EV world with massive production capacity and good battery technology.

[Tuesday](https://ibb.co/Q9JYY6D), we saw Jack Ma finally show up after numerous speculations of his disappearance. This is finally some good news for Alibaba and the shares are up over 6% since the spotting, after those speculations led to a continued sell-off in the stock as investors feared China’s Government implications around the company. Alibaba is still a great company that will remain one of the biggest e-commerce companies in this new world, and that is still fairly undervalued right now.

Sports betting soared again after the latest reports of new [records](https://ibb.co/KF1Wy78) in Pennsylvania with over $500M in wagers in December, and is also expected to go live in Michigan on [Friday](https://ibb.co/9spwZMT). Morgan Stanley also [expects](https://ibb.co/3CSLKFT) more states to push to the legalization of sport betting even faster than expected. I personally like companies like DKNG, PENN & WYNN in this sector and I am not planning on selling in the near-future any of them.

We also saw investment banks crushing earnings in the past days with [Goldman](https://ibb.co/6rzBBNh) crushing earnings by almost $5 and an increase of 18% y/y in revenues while Morgan Stanley also [BEAT](https://ibb.co/Lp3dJbp) expectations with an EPS beat of 64 cents and an increase in revenues bigger by over $2B than expected. I think the financial sector is pretty fairly valued right now after the huge run it has seen in the past [months](https://ibb.co/k0wTBVn) and it might only see another boost if rates go up, but that will inversely affect the rest of the stock market, so overall they might be a nice hedge against a potential rise in rates in the next years.

And one final thought is that I think staying invested in the markets is the best way to go as always. Even if the market experiences a short-term pullback or correction, I believe this will be short lived. It doesn’t matter if we see tax increases or not, it doesn’t even matter who is president… You should stay invested and look for the best opportunities in the markets.

[HERE](https://ibb.co/1QxtfSH) is the average SP500 return since 1933 under each president, and both averages are way above 5% for each party, far exceeding inflation expectation for the future, so stay invested, look for the best companies and hold even through tough times and even look to add on any weakness in the markets. Keep in mind that the [SP500](https://ibb.co/DKym45m) return for the first 100days of a new president is usually very good, with the last 3 terms returning at least 5%. We can also see the [DOW](https://ibb.co/VDG7vyC) has returned over 10% on an annualized basis for each of the past 3 terms, which is way over the historical average.

Biden has had the biggest [rally](https://ibb.co/wYZKGmT) between the election date and the inauguration date in the past 70 years, so, don’t expect huge gains like we have had since March, but do stay invested even if the markets start to see a slowdown… Your money is better off being invested rather than siting in a regular bank account where they will do nothing.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/9Z075Fy) markets seem to be pointing to another good day, after Biden’s inauguration and Janet Yellen’s latest remarks on the economy and the need of big spending, while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/rf6B1Z0) are also pointing to a green open, with the DOW leading the way.

Will Disney+ make this company a must have? What is my price prediction for Disney?** **Read until the end of the post** **as I reveal my price target for Disney and what I expect to happen next**

**\~Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and stock analysis in which we will go into an in-depth analysis about Disney’s stock! We are going to talk about Disney as a company and what’s the upside for the stock! So, let’s go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental, technical analysis, predictions, cash flows analysis and my price target for the stock in the next years & months.

Let’s start by talking a little about [Disney](https://ibb.co/PMhMz9f), yeah, I know everyone knows Disney, their movies, their parks and much more, but I believe Disney is still undervalued at this current price, especially due to their Disney+ and other streaming businesses which have taken of since the start of 2020.

Disney is the biggest entertainment company in the world, and has the 20th biggest market cap as they operate a number of profitable segments including cable networks like Disney, ESPN and many more others, while they also have a vast segment of parks & experiences including multiple Disneyland resorts, cruise lines and many others. Disney also operates a studio entertainment business under multiple big names like Marvel, Pixar, Walt Disney pictures and also offer Direct-to-Consumer networks & streaming services like Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and others. The company has over 200K employees and is nearing 100 years since it was founded.

So, we have to talk about the adjustment Disney has made starting in 2020. The company has cut the [dividend](https://ibb.co/YQQ8xLL) payouts and has focus its efforts into growing the company, with the company accelerating their move to an elite streaming business, which was supposed to have a time horizon of at least 3-4 years, and which has now surpassed all their expectations, and made the stock pop to all time highs of over $180 just recently.

Disney just had their latest Investors Day meeting in which they announced a lot of promising business opportunities for the company related to their developing streaming business.

They announced at least 10 Marvel [series](https://ibb.co/RQrxPfR) like Captain Marvel 2, a new Doctor Strange development while continuing [movies](https://ibb.co/87CcQ7B) for Thor, Black Panther and [others](https://ibb.co/Dpr73G2). They also announced at least 10 Star Wars [series](https://ibb.co/9HBrXZj) [including](https://ibb.co/PZkKTC4) the continuation of their big hit The Mandalorian and also provided updates on more child friendly productions with 15 Disney & Pixar [series](https://ibb.co/HNkMYvT).

The company has far outpaced any of their previous [GUIDANCE](https://ibb.co/vhWGCRd), as their initial guidance in all 3 big streaming services, Disney+, Hulu & ESPN have been reached in less than a year, with Disney+ and ESPN+ hitting the top of their expectations for 2024 while Hulu is just shy of their bottom expectations, as Disney+ was a hit since its start, with over 10M signups in the first [DAY](https://ibb.co/PW4WRfY).

Disney+ also keeps expanding into multiple countries, as they continued to launch the streaming business in over 15 [countries](https://ibb.co/Kwk9dd1) just recently in November, as their streaming services are [offered](https://ibb.co/4N8s3yt) on most devices like Android & Apple devices, Amazon’s Fire TV, Roku streaming platform and Google’s devices.

The company has extreme pricing power due to their capability to generate revenues from their other income streams but haven’t chosen to abuse that with only minor increases in price while also offering a great Disney [Bundle](https://ibb.co/R2p28zM) for just $13/month that includes the top 3 streaming services, Disney+, Hulu & ESPN+.

Hulu has seen a huge subscriber [growth](https://ibb.co/XkVCK72) in the past years, adding around 8M subscribers/year since 2017 as they offer multiple subscription [choices](https://ibb.co/sFnV4gV), starting from 6$ up to 71$ for their no ads & live TV service. After these results, Disney has slightly increased their bottom-line expectations for the [service](https://ibb.co/4sK1HR7) to 50M by 2024 and are expecting Hulu to become [profitable](https://ibb.co/W3C6Ybm) as soon as FY 2023.

They also revised the [ESPN+](https://ibb.co/S0wx121) expectations from between 8-12M to an incredible 20-30M subscribers range by 2024 as they also expect this service to become [profitable](https://ibb.co/4S8Qj8b) by FY 2023.

But guys, by far, the biggest [guidance](https://ibb.co/3swTzSG) upgrade for Disney has come from Disney+, with a revised guidance of over 230M and a top expectation of 260M subscribers by 2024, which is 30% more than Netflix has right now, after over 20 years since it was founded. They are also planning on [pricing](https://ibb.co/zZszZWR) Disney+ at $8/month starting this March, as they have revised the content [expense](https://ibb.co/kKK2Rxq) to over $8B for 2024, more than double their previous estimates, as they look to provide as much and as good as possible content for their customers.

Despite the huge number of subscribers, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/1Lrscqx) is still losing money due to very high costs of getting the service of the ground, but the company has revised their expectations and expect peak operating losses from Disney+ to come up this year and are expecting profitability by 2024, which is pretty much on schedule.

So, let’s go a little through the latest quarterly & yearly results for [Disney](https://ibb.co/x3n4Bmb). The company has been hugely affected due to the events that happened in 2020, as they were forced to close or operate at a significant reduced capacity their Parks, Experiences and Products segment. The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $0.20 for the 4th quarter and a loss of $2.02 for the year. Despite this loss I think the company has done as good as was possibly expected, as the situation accelerate their growth of their Disney+ service.

The company [reported](https://ibb.co/Bjpz16L) just over $7B in Media revenues for the 4th quarter and over $28B for the year, both of them being increases of at least 11% vs the previous year. Disney also reported a 41% increase in Direct-to-Consumer revenues for the 4th quarter with almost $17B in revenues for the year, while on the other hand both the Studio Entertainment & the Park, Experiences & Products segment saw a major loss of revenues, with both of them being down more than 50% for the 4th quarter vs 2019.

[Disney](https://ibb.co/G0KBJQG) also improved their operating results in both Media Networks and Direct-to-Consumer but only manage to obtain an operating income from their Media Networks and their Studio Entertainment business, totaling an operating income of just over $8B for the year, a 45% decrease over 2019.

Their latest moves to accelerate the growth of Disney+ had a big effect in the operating [results](https://ibb.co/t3wfwzC), as the costs of rolling out Disney+ eat up the revenues, while very few of their Movies were actually released to the cinema, which also impacted their Studio Entertainment top & bottom line. Also, to be noted that the eliminations segment includes the inter-segment transaction between their Media & Studio segments to their Direct-to-Consumer segment.

[Disney](https://ibb.co/SxXHZLK) also saw their Parks & Experiences revenues decline drastically as well as their operating results as a result of the closing or operating at a reduced capacity for all of their resorts, which is estimated to have had a negative impact of $2.4B for their operating income.

Studio Entertainment was hit just as bad with a decline of more than 50% in both revenues and operating income as theatrical releases were mostly put on pause as most of the theaters around the world have been closed or have operated at a significantly reduced capacity.

We also saw Direct-to-Consumer operating loss and revenues [improve](https://ibb.co/G7Sg19n) for the 4th quarter, as ESPN+ & Hulu were a boost while Disney+ continued to burn money at a very high rate, that is needed for a rapid growth of the service.

We can also see that all 3 major streaming services had a big increase year/year, with ESPN & HULU gaining more than 7M paid subscribers while Disney skyrocketed to over 86M after the latest numbers from their investors meeting. Despite this numbers the only increase in monthly revenue/subscriber was seen in [Hulu's](https://ibb.co/LzmrvwV) top package while the rest of them dropped, very likely due to the high number of promotions in the Asian markets.

It’s also to be noted that though most of their parks & resorts were affected, Disney didn’t stop investing in them and had a [Capex](https://ibb.co/2jsth35) of over $4B in 2020.

The [company](https://ibb.co/dk88L7f) also received other sources of income due to their gains in DraftKings, but most of these gains were offset by their interest expenses.

So, you should now that I am bull on Disney but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below!

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest [plans](https://ibb.co/9WxkCyd) announced by them and used some estimates and expectations of their revenues streams to normalize in the next years. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…

So, let’s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/mtb7s5y), though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon.

I implied the same growth rates for the total revenues based on my growth projections and also implied that EBITDA margin will slowly recover to the levels it stood before the massive investments in their streaming business, as the EBITDA margins [stood](https://ibb.co/Svr8NjN) at over 30% before that, and with streaming business being a very lucrative affair I can easily see that happen again.

I also used the Depreciation & Amortization from 2020 and implied a 10% growth, while also doing the same for the Net Working Capital. I used a 15% capex increases like I will do in my growth projections, and used a 9% discount rate, which is above the avg SP500 return in the past 60years.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for Disney I think the EBITDA approach is better suited as I expect the stock to be re-rated after they start to turn profitable on their streaming business and you will see with my growth method that it shows pretty much the same results.

So, this means we have an estimated $56B worth of FCF for a 9% discount rate. I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 3.5% rate after 2025, and that would mean that Disney will be worth almost $500B by 2025. So, let’s do the math for the growth approach and with a share count of 1.81B, that would mean a stock price of $175 and would imply a return of just over 2%. But I don’t expect this to be the best way to value the company. I think the EBITDA approach is better suited for the growth that lies ahead for the company. So, I wanted to be conservative and used only a 16 times EBITDA, which is the last multiple Disney traded before 2020, though I think with this new approach to the business we can see Disney valued at even higher multiples, maybe even 20 to 25. So, with this 16 times multiple, the stock would be undervalued by over 40% right now, but for safety reasons I would use an average of the 2 approaches. So, I expect [Disney](https://ibb.co/hM8mqnd) to trade around 210$ using the DCF model, which would imply a 22% return, which seems pretty good.

I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation [approach](https://ibb.co/jkL0JG9) for the future.

I like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings. So, let’s take a look at what Disney earnings/share will be by 2025.

For my [projections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c/edit#gid=1003936878) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. So, for the Media Networks I implied a 10% increase for next year and a decreasing growth after that and did pretty much the same for the Studio Entertainment Business. I did however imply a return to normal in Parks & Experiences revenues by 2022 and a slowing growth after that, while for the Direct-to-Consumer I implied a bigger growth rate as by their own forecast, Disney+ should account for around $20B in revenues by 2025 on its own.

For Disney’s cost of sales, I maintained the 68% expense ratio on their Media Networks, while for their Parks & Experiences I implied a very big cost of sales for the next 2 years and expect that to normalize towards the end of the period. Meanwhile for the Studio Entertainment business I actually used a bigger expense ratio just to be safe and for the Direct-to-Consumer cost of sales I implied a loss for 2021, a break even for 2022 and just starting to become positive after 2023 ending with a cost ratio of 75% in 2025. For the eliminations revenues and costs I implied a gradual 10% decrease in each year, but this shouldn’t affect the results that much in the end.

I used their Capex spending from 2020 and implied a 15% annual growth, as this will continue to increase at least for the next couple of years, while for the interest income & expenses I implied a 10% annual decrease, but this numbers are again so small that they don’t impact the end result that much, and didn’t want to assume and other significant losses or income.

I used the nominal US TAX rate of 21% and implied a .5% dilution of the stock each year.

So, let take a [recap](https://ibb.co/nj7sX5h), I expect Disney to have over $137B in revenues in 2025 and almost $35B in gross revenues. After subtracting their $8B capex and the almost $700M related to interest, and also account for the tax rate, Disney should have just over $20B in income after tax or just over $11 in earnings/share. So, adjusted for the .5% dilution, this would mean the stock is trading at just over 15 times price to 2025 earnings right now.

I know Disney has traded under a PE of 20 historically, but with them renouncing dividends and focusing on growth, especially as I can see every streaming business being valued very highly right now, I think we can see a multiple expansion on Disney vs the previous normal. So, depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 20 and 35, the stock can trade between $220 and almost $390.

So, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [Here](https://ibb.co/849LJH3) are my actual price targets… I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Disney trade at is $249 which would imply a return of over 45%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Disney will trade at 304$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 77% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $359, which would imply a return of 110%. So yeah guys, this are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 20 & 25 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 25 and 30 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 30-35.

So here is the [FULL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c) spreadsheet that I have projected for Disney by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Disney has had just in the past year in the past. The company has [increased](https://ibb.co/BP8SVHK) in value by more 18% despite all the obstacles it has faced and was up 57% in the 4 years [before](https://ibb.co/bHxHf5h) 2020. So yes, I think Disney will be one of the best re-opening plays and stay-at-home trades as well, so a win-win no matter what.

The company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/JntSMr8), with more than $35B in current assets vs only $26B in current liabilities and with over $200B in total assets. So, the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future, even after the bad year they had in 2020.

And let’s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts. We can see that the [analysts](https://ibb.co/1sRqCTB) expect somewhat smaller revenues by 2025, of around $115B compared to $137B that my Growth Valuations are projecting. But I think this haven’t been revised enough and don’t take into account fully what the streaming business will mean for them even after their other revenue streams come back to normal.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Disney?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/cTCvdgf), Disney has had a history of gapping up and then filling back the gap-up in the past 6 months with the stock doing so 2 times. But more recently they didn’t fill the gap-up after the vaccine news and even gapped even higher than that after the revised subscribers’ numbers revealed at the investors day. The stock was almost overbought and overbought for pretty long stretches of times in the last 6 months, but right now the RSI has dropped to 51, which could be a sign the stock is ready to move up once again. So, my personal opinion is that we can see the stock trade flat or even drop a little more but not below 158$ before the next quarterly [earnings](https://ibb.co/k8x6cCW) are released in February. Last time around they beat expectations by quite a lot and I think they might actually pull it off again with the increasing strength in the streaming business, and that might be enough to push the stock even higher. So, using the [DCF](https://ibb.co/ZfcJZz9) valuation, I think we can see Disney trading at around $210 by the end of the year, especially if things start to get back to normal and their parks & other revenues streams come back at increased strength.

And let’s take a quick look at what 27 [analysts](https://ibb.co/VJNg2m5) on Wall Street are saying. They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of $181 and a high price target of $220, as 20 of the 27 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Disney. So yet again, I think the analyst are undershooting the price of Disney, as it’s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Disney stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops to $160.

One last thing to mention about Disney is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 65% of the float being held by big [funds](https://ibb.co/5KRGT0Y) like Vanguard & Blackrock.

So, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Bob [Chapek](https://ibb.co/1JJzyq2) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO early in 2020, and has driven Disney to a renewed approach to their business, so, if you do want to check out the spreadsheets you can find the link [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c)!

[Disney](https://ibb.co/SxXHZLK) also saw their Parks & Experiences revenues decline drastically as well as their operating results as a result of the closing or operating at a reduced capacity for all of their resorts, which is estimated to have had a negative impact of $2.4B for their operating income.

Studio Entertainment was hit just as bad with a decline of more than 50% in both revenues and operating income as theatrical releases were mostly put on pause as most of the theaters around the world have been closed or have operated at a significantly reduced capacity.

We also saw Direct-to-Consumer operating loss and revenues [improve](https://ibb.co/G7Sg19n) for the 4th quarter, as ESPN+ & Hulu were a boost while Disney+ continued to burn money at a very high rate, that is needed for a rapid growth of the service.

We can also see that all 3 major streaming services had a big increase year/year, with ESPN & HULU gaining more than 7M paid subscribers while Disney skyrocketed to over 86M after the latest numbers from their investors meeting. Despite this numbers the only increase in monthly revenue/subscriber was seen in [Hulu's](https://ibb.co/LzmrvwV) top package while the rest of them dropped, very likely due to the high number of promotions in the Asian markets.

It’s also to be noted that though most of their parks & resorts were affected, Disney didn’t stop investing in them and had a [Capex](https://ibb.co/2jsth35) of over $4B in 2020.

The [company](https://ibb.co/dk88L7f) also received other sources of income due to their gains in DraftKings, but most of these gains were offset by their interest expenses.

So, you should now that I am bull on Disney but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below!

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest [plans](https://ibb.co/9WxkCyd) announced by them and used some estimates and expectations of their revenues streams to normalize in the next years. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…

So, let’s start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/mtb7s5y), though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon.

I implied the same growth rates for the total revenues based on my growth projections and also implied that EBITDA margin will slowly recover to the levels it stood before the massive investments in their streaming business, as the EBITDA margins [stood](https://ibb.co/Svr8NjN) at over 30% before that, and with streaming business being a very lucrative affair I can easily see that happen again.

I also used the Depreciation & Amortization from 2020 and implied a 10% growth, while also doing the same for the Net Working Capital. I used a 15% capex increases like I will do in my growth projections, and used a 9% discount rate, which is above the avg SP500 return in the past 60years.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for Disney I think the EBITDA approach is better suited as I expect the stock to be re-rated after they start to turn profitable on their streaming business and you will see with my growth method that it shows pretty much the same results.

So, this means we have an estimated $56B worth of FCF for a 9% discount rate. I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 3.5% rate after 2025, and that would mean that Disney will be worth almost $500B by 2025. So, let’s do the math for the growth approach and with a share count of 1.81B, that would mean a stock price of $175 and would imply a return of just over 2%. But I don’t expect this to be the best way to value the company. I think the EBITDA approach is better suited for the growth that lies ahead for the company. So, I wanted to be conservative and used only a 16 times EBITDA, which is the last multiple Disney traded before 2020, though I think with this new approach to the business we can see Disney valued at even higher multiples, maybe even 20 to 25. So, with this 16 times multiple, the stock would be undervalued by over 40% right now, but for safety reasons I would use an average of the 2 approaches. So, I expect [Disney](https://ibb.co/hM8mqnd) to trade around 210$ using the DCF model, which would imply a 22% return, which seems pretty good.

I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation [approach](https://ibb.co/jkL0JG9) for the future.

I like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings. So, let’s take a look at what Disney earnings/share will be by 2025.

For my [projections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c/edit#gid=1003936878) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. So, for the Media Networks I implied a 10% increase for next year and a decreasing growth after that and did pretty much the same for the Studio Entertainment Business. I did however imply a return to normal in Parks & Experiences revenues by 2022 and a slowing growth after that, while for the Direct-to-Consumer I implied a bigger growth rate as by their own forecast, Disney+ should account for around $20B in revenues by 2025 on its own.

For Disney’s cost of sales, I maintained the 68% expense ratio on their Media Networks, while for their Parks & Experiences I implied a very big cost of sales for the next 2 years and expect that to normalize towards the end of the period. Meanwhile for the Studio Entertainment business I actually used a bigger expense ratio just to be safe and for the Direct-to-Consumer cost of sales I implied a loss for 2021, a break even for 2022 and just starting to become positive after 2023 ending with a cost ratio of 75% in 2025. For the eliminations revenues and costs I implied a gradual 10% decrease in each year, but this shouldn’t affect the results that much in the end.

I used their Capex spending from 2020 and implied a 15% annual growth, as this will continue to increase at least for the next couple of years, while for the interest income & expenses I implied a 10% annual decrease, but this numbers are again so small that they don’t impact the end result that much, and didn’t want to assume and other significant losses or income.

I used the nominal US TAX rate of 21% and implied a .5% dilution of the stock each year.

So, let take a [recap](https://ibb.co/nj7sX5h), I expect Disney to have over $137B in revenues in 2025 and almost $35B in gross revenues. After subtracting their $8B capex and the almost $700M related to interest, and also account for the tax rate, Disney should have just over $20B in income after tax or just over $11 in earnings/share. So, adjusted for the .5% dilution, this would mean the stock is trading at just over 15 times price to 2025 earnings right now.

I know Disney has traded under a PE of 20 historically, but with them renouncing dividends and focusing on growth, especially as I can see every streaming business being valued very highly right now, I think we can see a multiple expansion on Disney vs the previous normal. So, depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 20 and 35, the stock can trade between $220 and almost $390.

So, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [Here](https://ibb.co/849LJH3) are my actual price targets… I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Disney trade at is $249 which would imply a return of over 45%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Disney will trade at 304$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 77% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $359, which would imply a return of 110%. So yeah guys, this are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 20 & 25 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 25 and 30 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 30-35.

So here is the [FULL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c) spreadsheet that I have projected for Disney by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Disney has had just in the past year in the past. The company has [increased](https://ibb.co/BP8SVHK) in value by more 18% despite all the obstacles it has faced and was up 57% in the 4 years [before](https://ibb.co/bHxHf5h) 2020. So yes, I think Disney will be one of the best re-opening plays and stay-at-home trades as well, so a win-win no matter what.

The company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/JntSMr8), with more than $35B in current assets vs only $26B in current liabilities and with over $200B in total assets. So, the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future, even after the bad year they had in 2020.

And let’s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts. We can see that the [analysts](https://ibb.co/1sRqCTB) expect somewhat smaller revenues by 2025, of around $115B compared to $137B that my Growth Valuations are projecting. But I think this haven’t been revised enough and don’t take into account fully what the streaming business will mean for them even after their other revenue streams come back to normal.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Disney?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/cTCvdgf), Disney has had a history of gapping up and then filling back the gap-up in the past 6 months with the stock doing so 2 times. But more recently they didn’t fill the gap-up after the vaccine news and even gapped even higher than that after the revised subscribers’ numbers revealed at the investors day. The stock was almost overbought and overbought for pretty long stretches of times in the last 6 months, but right now the RSI has dropped to 51, which could be a sign the stock is ready to move up once again. So, my personal opinion is that we can see the stock trade flat or even drop a little more but not below 158$ before the next quarterly [earnings](https://ibb.co/k8x6cCW) are released in February. Last time around they beat expectations by quite a lot and I think they might actually pull it off again with the increasing strength in the streaming business, and that might be enough to push the stock even higher. So, using the [DCF](https://ibb.co/ZfcJZz9) valuation, I think we can see Disney trading at around $210 by the end of the year, especially if things start to get back to normal and their parks & other revenues streams come back at increased strength.

And let’s take a quick look at what 27 [analysts](https://ibb.co/VJNg2m5) on Wall Street are saying. They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of $181 and a high price target of $220, as 20 of the 27 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Disney. So yet again, I think the analyst are undershooting the price of Disney, as it’s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Disney stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops to $160.

One last thing to mention about Disney is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 65% of the float being held by big [funds](https://ibb.co/5KRGT0Y) like Vanguard & Blackrock.

So, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Bob [Chapek](https://ibb.co/1JJzyq2) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO early in 2020, and has driven Disney to a renewed approach to their business, so, if you do want to check out the spreadsheets you can find the link [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c)!

Will Disney+ make this company a must have? What is my price prediction for Disney?** **Read until the end of the post** **as I reveal my price target for Disney and what I expect to happen next**

**\~Very Very Long Post\~ \~Don't read if you hate long posts!\~**

Hello everyone and stock analysis in which we will go into an in-depth analysis about Disney’s stock! We are going to talk about Disney as a company and what’s the upside for the stock! So, let’s go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental, technical analysis, predictions, cash flows analysis and my price target for the stock in the next years & months.

Let’s start by talking a little about [Disney](https://ibb.co/PMhMz9f), yeah, I know everyone knows Disney, their movies, their parks and much more, but I believe Disney is still undervalued at this current price, especially due to their Disney+ and other streaming businesses which have taken of since the start of 2020.

Disney is the biggest entertainment company in the world, and has the 20th biggest market cap as they operate a number of profitable segments including cable networks like Disney, ESPN and many more others, while they also have a vast segment of parks & experiences including multiple Disneyland resorts, cruise lines and many others. Disney also operates a studio entertainment business under multiple big names like Marvel, Pixar, Walt Disney pictures and also offer Direct-to-Consumer networks & streaming services like Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and others. The company has over 200K employees and is nearing 100 years since it was founded.

So, we have to talk about the adjustment Disney has made starting in 2020. The company has cut the [dividend](https://ibb.co/YQQ8xLL) payouts and has focus its efforts into growing the company, with the company accelerating their move to an elite streaming business, which was supposed to have a time horizon of at least 3-4 years, and which has now surpassed all their expectations, and made the stock pop to all time highs of over $180 just recently.

Disney just had their latest Investors Day meeting in which they announced a lot of promising business opportunities for the company related to their developing streaming business.

They announced at least 10 Marvel [series](https://ibb.co/RQrxPfR) like Captain Marvel 2, a new Doctor Strange development while continuing [movies](https://ibb.co/87CcQ7B) for Thor, Black Panther and [others](https://ibb.co/Dpr73G2). They also announced at least 10 Star Wars [series](https://ibb.co/9HBrXZj) [including](https://ibb.co/PZkKTC4) the continuation of their big hit The Mandalorian and also provided updates on more child friendly productions with 15 Disney & Pixar [series](https://ibb.co/HNkMYvT).

The company has far outpaced any of their previous [GUIDANCE](https://ibb.co/vhWGCRd), as their initial guidance in all 3 big streaming services, Disney+, Hulu & ESPN have been reached in less than a year, with Disney+ and ESPN+ hitting the top of their expectations for 2024 while Hulu is just shy of their bottom expectations, as Disney+ was a hit since its start, with over 10M signups in the first [DAY](https://ibb.co/PW4WRfY).

Disney+ also keeps expanding into multiple countries, as they continued to launch the streaming business in over 15 [countries](https://ibb.co/Kwk9dd1) just recently in November, as their streaming services are [offered](https://ibb.co/4N8s3yt) on most devices like Android & Apple devices, Amazon’s Fire TV, Roku streaming platform and Google’s devices.

The company has extreme pricing power due to their capability to generate revenues from their other income streams but haven’t chosen to abuse that with only minor increases in price while also offering a great Disney [Bundle](https://ibb.co/R2p28zM) for just $13/month that includes the top 3 streaming services, Disney+, Hulu & ESPN+.

Hulu has seen a huge subscriber [growth](https://ibb.co/XkVCK72) in the past years, adding around 8M subscribers/year since 2017 as they offer multiple subscription [choices](https://ibb.co/sFnV4gV), starting from 6$ up to 71$ for their no ads & live TV service. After these results, Disney has slightly increased their bottom-line expectations for the [service](https://ibb.co/4sK1HR7) to 50M by 2024 and are expecting Hulu to become [profitable](https://ibb.co/W3C6Ybm) as soon as FY 2023.

They also revised the [ESPN+](https://ibb.co/S0wx121) expectations from between 8-12M to an incredible 20-30M subscribers range by 2024 as they also expect this service to become [profitable](https://ibb.co/4S8Qj8b) by FY 2023.

But guys, by far, the biggest [guidance](https://ibb.co/3swTzSG) upgrade for Disney has come from Disney+, with a revised guidance of over 230M and a top expectation of 260M subscribers by 2024, which is 30% more than Netflix has right now, after over 20 years since it was founded. They are also planning on [pricing](https://ibb.co/zZszZWR) Disney+ at $8/month starting this March, as they have revised the content [expense](https://ibb.co/kKK2Rxq) to over $8B for 2024, more than double their previous estimates, as they look to provide as much and as good as possible content for their customers.

Despite the huge number of subscribers, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/1Lrscqx) is still losing money due to very high costs of getting the service of the ground, but the company has revised their expectations and expect peak operating losses from Disney+ to come up this year and are expecting profitability by 2024, which is pretty much on schedule.

So, let’s go a little through the latest quarterly & yearly results for [Disney](https://ibb.co/x3n4Bmb). The company has been hugely affected due to the events that happened in 2020, as they were forced to close or operate at a significant reduced capacity their Parks, Experiences and Products segment. The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $0.20 for the 4th quarter and a loss of $2.02 for the year. Despite this loss I think the company has done as good as was possibly expected, as the situation accelerate their growth of their Disney+ service.

The company [reported](https://ibb.co/Bjpz16L) just over $7B in Media revenues for the 4th quarter and over $28B for the year, both of them being increases of at least 11% vs the previous year. Disney also reported a 41% increase in Direct-to-Consumer revenues for the 4th quarter with almost $17B in revenues for the year, while on the other hand both the Studio Entertainment & the Park, Experiences & Products segment saw a major loss of revenues, with both of them being down more than 50% for the 4th quarter vs 2019.

[Disney](https://ibb.co/G0KBJQG) also improved their operating results in both Media Networks and Direct-to-Consumer but only manage to obtain an operating income from their Media Networks and their Studio Entertainment business, totaling an operating income of just over $8B for the year, a 45% decrease over 2019.

Their latest moves to accelerate the growth of Disney+ had a big effect in the operating [results](https://ibb.co/t3wfwzC), as the costs of rolling out Disney+ eat up the revenues, while very few of their Movies were actually released to the cinema, which also impacted their Studio Entertainment top & bottom line. Also, to be noted that the eliminations segment includes the inter-segment transaction between their Media & Studio segments to their Direct-to-Consumer segment.

[Disney](https://ibb.co/SxXHZLK) also saw their Parks & Experiences revenues decline drastically as well as their operating results as a result of the closing or operating at a reduced capacity for all of their resorts, which is estimated to have had a negative impact of $2.4B for their operating income.

Studio Entertainment was hit just as bad with a decline of more than 50% in both revenues and operating income as theatrical releases were mostly put on pause as most of the theaters around the world have been closed or have operated at a significantly reduced capacity.

We also saw Direct-to-Consumer operating loss and revenues [improve](https://ibb.co/G7Sg19n) for the 4th quarter, as ESPN+ & Hulu were a boost while Disney+ continued to burn money at a very high rate, that is needed for a rapid growth of the service.

We can also see that all 3 major streaming services had a big increase year/year, with ESPN & HULU gaining more than 7M paid subscribers while Disney skyrocketed to over 86M after the latest numbers from their investors meeting. Despite this numbers the only increase in monthly revenue/subscriber was seen in [Hulu's](https://ibb.co/LzmrvwV) top package while the rest of them dropped, very likely due to the high number of promotions in the Asian markets.

It’s also to be noted that though most of their parks & resorts were affected, Disney didn’t stop investing in them and had a [Capex](https://ibb.co/2jsth35) of over $4B in 2020.

The [company](https://ibb.co/dk88L7f) also received other sources of income due to their gains in DraftKings, but most of these gains were offset by their interest expenses.

So, you should now that I am bull on Disney but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below!

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest [plans](https://ibb.co/9WxkCyd) announced by them and used some estimates and expectations of their revenues streams to normalize in the next years. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…

So, let’s do the math for the growth approach and with a share count of 1.81B, that would mean a stock price of $175 and would imply a return of just over 2%. But I don’t expect this to be the best way to value the company. I think the EBITDA approach is better suited for the growth that lies ahead for the company. So, I wanted to be conservative and used only a 16 times EBITDA, which is the last multiple Disney traded before 2020, though I think with this new approach to the business we can see Disney valued at even higher multiples, maybe even 20 to 25. So, with this 16 times multiple, the stock would be undervalued by over 40% right now, but for safety reasons I would use an average of the 2 approaches. So, I expect [Disney](https://ibb.co/hM8mqnd) to trade around 210$ using the DCF model, which would imply a 22% return, which seems pretty good.

I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation [approach](https://ibb.co/jkL0JG9) for the future.

I like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings. So, let’s take a look at what Disney earnings/share will be by 2025.

For my [projections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c/edit#gid=1003936878) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. So, for the Media Networks I implied a 10% increase for next year and a decreasing growth after that and did pretty much the same for the Studio Entertainment Business. I did however imply a return to normal in Parks & Experiences revenues by 2022 and a slowing growth after that, while for the Direct-to-Consumer I implied a bigger growth rate as by their own forecast, Disney+ should account for around $20B in revenues by 2025 on its own.

For the eliminations revenues and costs I implied a gradual 10% decrease in each year, but this shouldn’t affect the results that much in the end.

I used their Capex spending from 2020 and implied a 15% annual growth, as this will continue to increase at least for the next couple of years, while for the interest income & expenses I implied a 10% annual decrease, but this numbers are again so small that they don’t impact the end result that much, and didn’t want to assume and other significant losses or income.

I used the nominal US TAX rate of 21% and implied a .5% dilution of the stock each year.

So, let take a [recap](https://ibb.co/nj7sX5h), I expect Disney to have over $137B in revenues in 2025 and almost $35B in gross revenues. After subtracting their $8B capex and the almost $700M related to interest, and also account for the tax rate, Disney should have just over $20B in income after tax or just over $11 in earnings/share. So, adjusted for the .5% dilution, this would mean the stock is trading at just over 15 times price to 2025 earnings right now.

I know Disney has traded under a PE of 20 historically, but with them renouncing dividends and focusing on growth, especially as I can see every streaming business being valued very highly right now, I think we can see a multiple expansion on Disney vs the previous normal.

So here is the [FULL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c) spreadsheet that I have projected for Disney by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

So yes, I think Disney will be one of the best re-opening plays and stay-at-home trades as well, so a win-win no matter what.

The company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/JntSMr8), with more than $35B in current assets vs only $26B in current liabilities and with over $200B in total assets. So, the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future, even after the bad year they had in 2020.

And let’s also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts. We can see that the [analysts](https://ibb.co/1sRqCTB) expect somewhat smaller revenues by 2025, of around $115B compared to $137B that my Growth Valuations are projecting. But I think this haven’t been revised enough and don’t take into account fully what the streaming business will mean for them even after their other revenue streams come back to normal.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Disney?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/cTCvdgf), Disney has had a history of gapping up and then filling back the gap-up in the past 6 months with the stock doing so 2 times. But more recently they didn’t fill the gap-up after the vaccine news and even gapped even higher than that after the revised subscribers’ numbers revealed at the investors day. The stock was almost overbought and overbought for pretty long stretches of times in the last 6 months, but right now the RSI has dropped to 51, which could be a sign the stock is ready to move up once again. So, my personal opinion is that we can see the stock trade flat or even drop a little more but not below 158$ before the next quarterly [earnings](https://ibb.co/k8x6cCW) are released in February. Last time around they beat expectations by quite a lot and I think they might actually pull it off again with the increasing strength in the streaming business, and that might be enough to push the stock even higher. So, using the [DCF](https://ibb.co/ZfcJZz9) valuation, I think we can see Disney trading at around $210 by the end of the year, especially if things start to get back to normal and their parks & other revenues streams come back at increased strength.

And let’s take a quick look at what 27 [analysts](https://ibb.co/VJNg2m5) on Wall Street are saying. They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of $181 and a high price target of $220, as 20 of the 27 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Disney. So yet again, I think the analyst are undershooting the price of Disney, as it’s always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Disney stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops to $160.

One last thing to mention about Disney is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 65% of the float being held by big [funds](https://ibb.co/5KRGT0Y) like Vanguard & Blackrock.

So, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Bob [Chapek](https://ibb.co/1JJzyq2) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO early in 2020, and has driven Disney to a renewed approach to their business, so, if you do want to check out the spreadsheets you can find the link [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c)!

Stocks traded choppily today ahead of a busy week that will include a slew of corporate earnings, a meeting by the Federal Open Market Committee, and a debate over President Biden’s new $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal.

Since his administration took over, market participants have been looking at President Biden to push for Congress to prioritize his new stimulus package. However, a bipartisan group of lawmakers has already pushed back against Biden’s proposal, according to a report by Bloomberg. Passing the new proposal after more than $3 trillion in stimulus was passed last year was always going to be a challenge. Moving forward, we suspect Biden's proposal will be scaled back in the negotiation process, but believe another sizable relief package is likely coming soon. Senate Majority Leader said Congress would aim to pass the next coronavirus relief bill in the next “four to six weeks.”

On January 21, 2020, the first patient in the US was hospitalized with coronavirus. Roughly one year later, the USOn January 21, 2020, the first patient in the US was hospitalized with coronavirus. Roughly one year later, the US has recorded more than 25 million total and is averaging roughly 175,000 new infections and 3,000 per day over the last week, according to Johns Hopkins University. For context, the death toll of 3,000 Americans per day is higher than during the height of the Second World War, according to CNN. 

The more-infectious variant of the coronavirus, first detected in the United Kingdom, has been detected in at least 22 states, according to the CDC. A recent release from the UK states there is “a realistic possibility that the new coronavirus strain, dubbed B.1.1.7, is both deadlier and more infectious. ""The data is mounting -- and some of it I can't share -- that clearly supports that B.1.1.7 is causing more severe illness and increased death,"" infectious disease expert Michael Osterholm said. ""Already we know this variant has increased transmission, and so this is more very bad news."" As the vaccine rollout continues underway, governments across the world are reimposing virus-related restrictions and are urging their citizens to stay inside and follow social distancing guidelines.

l4twvg,35,50,investing,AI could be front-running WallStreetBets,0.82,1611627805.0,1611599005.0,"There is an ETF that makes trades based on artificial intelligence (ticker: AIEQ). The AI combs through mountains of data (expressly including social media and regular news reporting). When I heard about it, I was originally dubious about its ability to beat a relatively efficient market based on searching through this dataset, but I was curious. So I bought a little bit when it debuted, and it didn't do much of anything, and indeed kinda underperformed so I lost patience and sold it. But I remember an AI podcast I heard that talked about machine learning and how early on (with Chess, or Go, or other tests), humans would beat the AI easily. But then over time, AI progressively learned and then became unbeatable. So I took a flyer and bought back into AIEQ in early November and continued to leg into the position, and it continues to do well. I ran a three month chart vs. SPY and Vanguard's Total Stock Index. It is beating both handily. (This is true on longer time periods also, but I didn't own it before November). Moreover, the outperformance seems to be accelerating, which could mean the AI is learning and improving as it goes.

That outperformance raised my eyebrows, and I was surprised that this dataset had in fact yielded actionable alpha. Then I heard about wallstreetbets. And then I made the connection - AIEQ may be outperforming because it is reading all the Reddit trade discussion, and is following or perhaps even front-running those trades. If you look at AIEQ's top portfolio positions, they are full of Reddit faves like TSLA, ENPH, SPWR, AMD, ROKU, ETSY, SQ, MRNA, ZS, CRWD, PLUG, etc. I don't know if my theory is correct (the AI trading methodology is a black box), but it's certainly food for thought.",2021-01-25

l9246n,181,206,wallstreetbets,Customer-Centric Fundamental Analysis of $AMC,0.87,1612088366.0,1612059566.0,"$GME featured later in the post, too. 🚀🚀

Sorry if this DD sucks ass and leads a bunch of people to ditch $AMC. Just focus on the future, and think about the mind of the consumer. Most of that shit they teach in business school is bullshit is trash. Trust me. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

​
I will return to that a bit later in this DD. Here's another take based on fundamentals on why you might consider $AMC at \~$13/share one of the great value investment opportunities of our time. ~~Bear~~ with me as I, too, am just a retard like some of the readers here.
​
Let's begin with the basic asymmetries in a macroeconomic context:
​
* Market Cap (MC):  427.869 M
* Enterprise Value (EV): 11.349 B
​

When seeing that figure, you might wonder if you don't know shit, why might a company have an enterprise value so much greater than its Market Cap. A Company's EV is the total debt + market cap - cash on hand. As you may have heard in the recent news, nobody is having trouble getting access to cash. So then, why might that figure be significant at all if it is practically just about how much the company owes + aggregate value of the stonk. Well, my father used to say, the price of a product is what someone is willing to pay for it. If someone wanted to buy or takeover AMC, they need to pay around 11.349 B. In a few months, I anticipate that number to be so much higher.
​

The main reason I think $AMC dropped so low and generated so much short seller risk to begin with is the fact that there was a bankruptcy risk. That risk has been wholly eliminated, though I never saw it.
​

As we find ourselves in a cash flush world where at least 18 Trillion in debt is negative yielding ([mostly bonds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/world-s-negative-yield-debt-pile-at-18-trillion-for-first-time)), we should expect a company with so many assets and a previously healthy balance sheet like AMC to be have access to some of it. The rising stonk price even incentivized Silverlake to convert their debt to shares and sell them (silly bankers).
​

At the same time, the all-star CEO boomer Adam Aron himself grabbed an additional $304.8 M in cash through a direct listing initiated on Monday. I don't know why he couldn't wait until Wednesday to initiate because [it would've been over $1B](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amc-ent-holdg-stock-sale/amc-seizes-on-rally-to-sell-stock-but-misses-even-bigger-payday-idUSKBN29W2UP). I trust his judgement. Boomers are more experienced and have ~~steady~~ hands. At the same time, Aron beat back the well known short selling smuts known as Apollo Global Management as they attempted to force bankruptcy on AMC.
​

The confluence of these factors (EV, Access to Liquidity, Stellar Executive Team) and the four I outline below, lead me to believe that even Stevie Wonder can see that this stock is obviously worth at least $30/share.  
​
​

**The undisputed market leader in theaters.**
​

* 1,0004 Theatres worldwide
   * Many auditoriums at AMC locations, often holding over more than one auditorium, seat over 400 people. 
      * They posted 5.47 million in revenues. Auditoriums were rarely at capacity.
   * 8,043 screens/auditoriums.
   * They will all be packed when opened back up.
      * Tons of really great movies were held anticipating the end of the lockdown and the re-opening of the movies. Keep this in mind. This is critical to the fundamental analysis and related to the subsequent points.
   * Margins are *ok* but especially good on the snacks. In the past, consumers have tended to say fuck AMC's margins and bring in their own goodies either because AMC's were ass or because they wanted to save a few dollars. We expect this pattern to slow down substantially because of what they mean for the people.  I recognize that this one is a reach, but it's my opinion not investment advice.
​

**The shifting sentiment from ""Netflix and Chill"" to in-person, shared and enjoyable experience.**
​

* I don't like people, but I miss them. Maybe you do too. In a mid-pandemic Gallup Poll, we all know how much those matter, [71% of consumers want to go to the fucking theaters](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/movie-theaters-covid-consumers-uncomfortable-1234846743/). If I just put my finger in the air and give 35% of Netflix's market cap to AMC... you see where I'm going with this.
* I have seen others say this one as well, but I miss when everyone went to the movies and watch the same thing, on the same screen, at the same time because we can share. 
* Netflix and the streamers need to watch out because come July, the boomer is coming with that heat. Everyone is anticipating trips to movies. I tried to make the popcorn. I used a half a stick of butter. It's not the same.
   * Running to 7-Eleven to get Slurpees and Raisinets while Netflix is buffering is super annoying. Last time, my 7-Eleven didn't even have Raisinets. \[Samuel L. Jackson voice\] ""Where's my mothafuckin Raisinets Jack?""
* As you think through this point, remember the last time you saw Samuel L. Jackson in the theaters. you weren't the only that was scared, so it was entertaining and not stressful.
* This point isn't totally out of my ass either. As streaming popularity has grown, so has AMC's  revenues, not including 2020. People watch more movies.
​

**Relationship with distributors and studios is still a strong moat.**   

Everyone here should check out a movie. They don't have the awesome search and browse capabilities afforded by Netflix or the sweeping device compatibility. You can stream from your laptop and connect to your.  
​
​
* Studios have ben delaying their films repeatedly to wait for AMC to open back up. To me, that sounds like immense power and a very strong relationship. I commend the studios for that and I think you have to be a hedge fund jackass not value that moat accordingly. Even Morningstar sees that and they usually don't see shit!
* The Netflix app is cool but we can all agree, &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 80% of the content is ass. Movies are a crap shoot. Shows are a political statement. And there's not enough Chapelle.
   * What Chapelle represents amongst so many other things is someone who has walked away from the traditional film industry. While I am all for the new person on the block, I feel movies are very hard to make. Sometimes the Netflix ones suck hard. I don't recall too many times when I went to a movie theater and had to leave because the movie sucked that bad. I've been disappointed, underwhelmed, but have never chucked my remote at the screen. I cannot say the same about Netflix. I have seen some terrible shit on Netflix, multiple times. I go there every day still because their app is so good, but Hollywood is still better at making films than Los Gatos or wherever the fuck. \*
* You can rent some of the movies that would be in theaters now. I'm sure the quality of the acting and dialogue will be superior to the shit we often get on Netflix.
   * I haven't done it yet, but I promise to do it for the first time tonight as I discovered the [On Demand](https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/news-of-the-world-61825) product line in doing some research for this DD. I assure you that the products will be overpriced, and the digital experience will be ass, but they just got $300 M to go figure that shit out. 
   * Boomer CEO: Lower your price point and move your on-prem servers to EC2 instances. You got this! Re-invest hard for a while as you build up the integrations to be a first-class citizen in Roku, etc. 

​
**Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice.**

In doing more research, I learned that both AMC and AMCX were seeing incredible short interest. Every resource I used reported both higher than they should be, but the inconsistency in the numbers from trusted and premium services has led me to withhold my numbers.  The ranges for AMC were between 24% of total float and 68% of total float. When I tried to calculate myself based on short interest theory and the average volume of the stock as of  a month ago, I landed at 62. Since I am retarded, the answer is probably in the 40-50. 

​
*Current short volume:* 44,670,000 shares


*True Float:*  71,000,000 shares

​
*Dollar Volume Sold Short:* $385.50 million 

​
On the last one yes, you read that right. This idiots have sold more short volume in price than the market cap of the stock. How could they do this shit all over again. They don't give a fuck. They think they will get away with it. 
​


Regardless, some idiots sold another 8,000,000 shares short ON FRIDAY. Well, I have 2500 shares across four platforms. I am buying more on Monday, but my buddy had an interesting idea because the stock is so low. Options may actually be an even better play for me because I can buy hundreds of them (thanks to this subreddit). If I exercise as many options as I can hold the stock with diamond hands, it could accelerate the gamma squeeze that will happen if those short selling assholes don't back down.  And we know they won't . 

​
In closing, as with $GME, I have fond memories of my times at AMC as a child and teenager. It was the first place my friend drove me after he got his license. 
​
Also as with $GME, I like the stock.

​
*Positions*

​
shares: 2479, avg cost basis of 6.54,  I have been building up for a while

​
options: a lot (strike prices ranging from $2.5 to $9 because these jackasses thought they knew wtf was going on but are out of touch with the commoner. On Monday, I will buy more. 98% of my options are already in cheese.
​
​
On WeBull, I learned that you can buy stonks starting at 4 AM / 7 AM or something like that so I am moving some money in there.
​

Edit: I will set a limit order of 100 to expire in 90 days, the brokerage cannot sell my shares. If I still don’t want to sell at that price and it gets close, just add another $100. I will never sell, but always have a limit order if these short sellers want to try and screw you out of deep fucking value.

larhlw,61,270,wallstreetbets,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,0.94,1612285195.0,1612256395.0,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

I'll let y'all discuss what this means in the comments. Have Fun.

EDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script. Fixed, and added a bit more data

EDIT 2 - For those without enough brain wrinkles / attention span to interpret this - There may have been shady shit in the first few days of Jan, but doesn't look like anything went on in the second week. Will need to wait till Feb 15 to see data in the last few weeks of Jan. I'll probably do some more analysis when that time comes",2021-02-02
lbb8zv,38,47,stocks,$MGNI: Why it is STILL a great time to buy,0.93,1612341716.0,1612312916.0,"  

**TL/DR at the bottom**

This post unsurprisingly didn't get any love on WSB (No GME in post, but I do think the squeeze is still in play) so I'm posting it here hoping for a better discussion.

**What does Magnite ($MGNI) do?**

\- **World’s largest independent supply-side advertising technology company**. This means they help fill advertising space, primarily on websites, apps, and **connected TV (CTV)** platforms. Price per share at time of writing: $40.20

**CTV -** Basically anything that is not cable TV is connected TV. Connecting through your xbox or roku or apple TV or however you want to stream TV. This is the **primary source of revenue** for $MGNI. Are you on the poor people version of Hulu that runs ads? Those ads run through MGNI.

So let me ask you - is there a movement towards cable TV, or a movement towards finding other ways to watch TV through streaming services? I think you know the answer. And that is reason #1 to buy in. **As CTV increases in popularity, so does demand for advertising space, and so does $MGNI revenue.**

**Industry comparison -**

Trade Desk ($TTD). TTD operates on the buy side of ad tech, so while not exactly the same, they are within the same industry. TTD is currently **up 2800%** over the last 4 years, with a market cap of $38.5 billion. Where is $MGNI? A shade under $5 billion. Now is it realistic to expect MGNI to be the next home run play like TTD (who my brother sold for $50/share, RIP)? Predicting anything to go up 2800% in 4 years is unlikely but who knows. But **if MGNI can get to even half the market cap of TTD, that is a price target of $160.** (Current: $40/share, Mcap 4.75 Billion)

**Past/future earnings:**

Past earnings and future earnings show the story of a company with fairly rapid growth. Take a look for yourself:

Q1 2020 Revenue - $36.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q1 2019

Q2 2020 Revenue - $42.3MM, up 12% YoY from Q2 2019

Q3 2020 Revenue - $61MM, up 62% YoY from Q3 2019

*Q4 2020 Revenue - Expected $72-75MM, up \~50% YoY from Q4 2019*

**$MGNI is up %335 in the past 12 mo, am I too late to the party?**

Answer: **NO,** and although I already outlined some reasons why above, here is a list for you:

&#x200B;

1. CTV will      only increase in popularity, which is where the bulk of MGNI revenue comes      from
2. $MGNI is      showing accelerated growth, great for a mid-cap company to try to make the      jump to large-cap
3. Trade Desk      (TTD), who is not a competitor but is in the same industry, is valued      nearly 10x higher than MGNI.
4. Earnings      coming up 2/24, which I expect MGNI to crush, and I do not think that      earnings are priced in yet.
5. Needham      analyst Laura Martin makes MGNI her top pick for 2021, saying 500% growth      is possible (Jan 13 [Why Wall Street analysts think Magnite may be the      next hot play in ad tech (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/why-wall-street-analysts-think-magnite-may-be-the-next-hot-play-in-ad-tech.html))
6. Survived a      short hit piece by Spruce Point Capital on Jan 8 (Thank you for a low      entry point for some calls)
7. **PR Today: Launch of “Unified Decisioning”,** a new MGNI product/software. From article:

*“Publishers are eager to tap into the efficiencies that programmatic provides without relinquishing the control they are used to when selling directly to buyers. Unified Decisioning enables them to do both and we’re excited to bring these capabilities to leading CTV publishers.”* Link: [*Magnite Introduces Open Beta of New CTV & OTT Solution Named Unified Decisioning | Business Wire*](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005138/en/Magnite-Introduces-Open-Beta-of-New-CTV-OTT-Solution-Named-Unified-Decisioning)

If you’re interested in companies that are trending from bottom-left to top-right, then I encourage you to invest in $MGNI. I believe it is a **good short-term play**; having just went on a weeklong dip from Jan 22 - Jan 29, I think you have a decent entry point here at $41.50, although I believe any entry point is fine at this stage in the company’s growth. Also in the short-term is earnings on 2/24 which I believe will be good for MGNI. It is also a **good long-term play** for reasons above, my EOY price target is $125, although it would not surprise me if it goes significantly higher. The $MGNI train hasn’t even left the station!

Positions: 100 shares @ $16, 2/19 35c x5, 2/19 40c x2, 2/19 45c x10, 2/19 50c x2 (Slight degeneracy)

**TL/DR:** MGNI is a growing company in the growing industry of advertising in (primarily) connected TV services (Think: Roku). Same realm as $TTD but 1/10th the market cap. Much room to grow. Earnings coming up 2/24 and Laura Martin’s stock pick of 2021. Just released beta of new software today. Not financial advice, I just like the stock.

Edit: MGNI acquires SpotX for 1.1 billion. (2/5/2021)

lc5c63,12,39,stocks,FUBO could squeeze shorts,0.73,1612434925.0,1612406125.0,"
[link to article and charting](https://houndermedia.com/fubo-could-get-the-squeeze/)

As shown by AMC and GameStop, bears have been getting shlonged. The idea behind taking a position in FUBO is quite simple: We're gonna squeeze shorts.

Not only does this play fit the theme of short squeezing that has been going on, but this is also a technical and fundamentally sound trade (not a financial advisor by the way). FuboTV is now the second-most shorted name in the US, behind GameStop. S3 Managing Partner Ihor Dusaniwsky's short interest in FUBO stock is now $1.7 billion, or 67.08% of the float, a 27% increase in two days.  I'm not saying it'll be the next Gamestop-like squeeze, but it has the potential to be epic.

Q4 total revenue is expected to be between $94-$98 million, a 77% to 84% increase year-over-year. Prior expectations were $80-$85 million.
Paid subscribers at year-end are expected to exceed 545,000, in increase of more than 72% year-over-year. Before it was 500,000-510,000 subscribers.
They will continue to be focused on executing their growth strategies, which include continuing to grow advertising revenues, working to implement sports wagering and further establishing FuboTV as a sports and live streaming service.
The fastest growing live-streaming platform with a revenue growth rate of 84% and a SuperBowl catalyst. People are going to be watching that game on Fubo and they'll probably have a commercial on too.
Closed an offering of $350m on January 16th, Disney owns 10% and there are Roku/Spotify investors on the Board of Directors.

David Einhorn recently revealed his Greenlight Capital was an early FuboTV investor, and he sees a bright future for the company where it can separate itself rather than directly compete, with traditional sportsbook operators.

But there were still plenty of bulls and I did my research before buying, so I decided I would make it by biggest individual stock holding. But then it dipped, and being a relatively new investor at the time I was still very finicky. So I sold. At the time many people started talking about how it was a crowded field and there would be no way for them to make money and they couldn’t compete with other big names etc. etc. Go back and look at Seeking Alpha and Reddit comments about Roku from 2018 and you’ll see the negative chitter chatter. Well...just a couple short years later it’s now over 400/share with a market cap of 50 billion. It’s one of those that makes me proud that I saw the opportunity when I did but also makes me sick to look at. 

I see something similar brewing here, with a lot of uninformed folks talking about how Fubo is “no different than cable” due to the price (yeah try to pay for cable sports packages with all Fubos channels and see if that stays under $60, not to mention the ability to watch any shows aired in the last 72 hours), how they’d be screwed if someone else offered the same at a lower price, if they lost their rights to certain channels, etc etc.  Even some of the little similarities are funny, like “Roku TVs” becoming a thing, and now Fubo buttons are being added to Hisense TV remotes.  But I digress...of course they aren’t perfect yet and there are always risks but this time...I’m holding on. As long as subscribers keep increasing, positive reviews on app stores roll in, and they continue improving in general, why not?

**Introduction**

“[FuboTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV) ($FUBO) is an American streaming television service that focuses primarily on channels that distribute live sports, including NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS and international soccer, plus news, network television series and movies.

Launched on January 1, 2015 as a soccer streaming service, FuboTV changed to an all-sports service in 2017 and then to a virtual multichannel video programming distributor (vMVPD) model. As a vMVPD, FuboTV still calls itself sports-first but its expanded channel lineup targets cord cutters, offering a selection of major cable channels and OTT-originated features that can be streamed through smart TVs, mobile and tablets and the web. The service is available in the United States, Canada and Spain as of 2018.""

From their [home](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome) page:

They are the only competitors in their space of digital sports broadcasting, offer 4K streaming and upscaling of live sports, cloud DVR capability ranging from 250 or 1000 hours on standard plans, and is available on Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Chromecast, Samsung Smart TVs, Xbox One, Android TV, Android Smart TVs, and Android/iOS smartphones and tablets, with plans ranging from $24.99/month to $79.99/month (not including add-ons).

[They have also recently acquired one company and have made plans to acquire another to allow for in-house sports betting. They have stated in a press release that they plan to release a sportsbook before the end of the year.](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/fubotv-accelerates-development-sportsbook-140000632.html) This will push them into a broader spectrum outside of only TV and sports streaming, and into the sports betting sector along with DraftKings ($DKNG), FanDuel ($PDYPY), and Penn National Gaming ($PENN).

[**Plans and Add-ons**](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/channels)

FuboTV offers three standardized plans as of February 8, 2021: the Family plan is priced at $64.99/month (normally $75.97/month), Elite at $79.99/month (normally $100.95/month), and Latino Quarterly at $24.99/month, along with offering additional add-ons. Each plan offers a range of channels, cloud DVR capabilities (which allows fast-forwarding through commercials), and casting to multiple devices simultaneously. Only the Elite plan does not offer a 7-day free trial (*Channels page).*

The Family plan includes 117 channels (mostly news and entertainment with roughly 40 that offer sports, including ESPN), up to 250 hours of DVR space, and casting to 3 devices at once. The quarterly prepaid includes a free upgrade to 1000 hours of DVR space and 5 casting devices at home with 3 on the go (*Channels page).*

The Elite plan includes 164 channels (includes an additional “47 entertainment channels”), up to 1000 hours of DVR space, and casting to 5 devices at home with 3 on the go. This plan does not offer a quarterly prepaid (*Channels page).*

The Latino Quarterly plan includes 250 hours of DVR space and can be streamed on up to 3 devices at once, but only has 32 channels. This plan needs to be prepaid every 3 months for a total charge of $74.97 and does not offer a monthly service (*Channels page).*

Upgrades include additional DVR space--1000 hours for an additional $6.99/month for the Family and Latino Quarterly--and increased device casting--an additional 2 devices at home with 3 on the go for another $9.99/month for the Family and Latino Quarterly plans. You can also add a variety of channels and sports packages (the Latino Quarterly has fewer channel add-ons compared to the Family and Elite plans, which both have the same channel varieties). Sports Plus with NFL RedZone is an additional $10.99/month, but includes all professional and college sports broadcasting services for football, basketball, baseball, hockey, tennis, fighting, etc. (*Channels page).*

Fubo has recently removed its former Standard plan, which included only 65 channels, up to 2 casting devices, and only 30 hours of DVR support for $60/month.

**Financials and Growth**

Fubo has yet to file an annual report as they have gone public in October of 2020, but they have filed a [10-Q](https://s21.q4cdn.com/819998841/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/16be93b6-1b43-471a-a81f-a8b07e43e47c.pdf) for Q3 2020. All numbers in thousands.

Assets-

Between December 31, 2019 and September of 2020, assets have increased from $368,225 to $799,313 (a 117% increase) . Total current assets increased from $17,973 to $58,016, but accounts receivable decreased from $8,904 to $6,975--this may be attributed to the increase in prepaid subscriptions which increased from $1,445 to $12,177 which shows strong customer satisfaction and retention.

Liabilities-

Liabilities have increased from $145,049 to $290,376 (a 100% increase). The largest contributors to their liabilities are “Due to related parties” increasing from $665 to $85,847, “Warrant liabilities” increasing from $24 to $28,085, and “Accounts payable” from $36,373 to $61,679. Long-term borrowings have decreased from $43,982 to $25,905.

Revenues-

Subscription revenues increased by $53,433, totaling $92,945 for the year. Total revenues including advertisements and licensing have increased by $61,202, totaling $112,669 for the year and an increase of 47% YOY. Q4 revenue is estimated to be between $94,000 and $98,000 which would be a 77-84% increase YOY.

Expenses-

Subscriber related expenses total $114,315 for the year. Total expenses have totaled $500,249 for the year.

Subscribers-

Ended Q3 with 455,000 paid subscribers, a YOY increase of 58%, and plans to end 2020 with over 545,000, an increase of 72% YOY.

**The vMVPD Sector**

Cord-cutting has become increasingly popular over the last few years with consumers dropping traditional cable and satellite networks in favor of streaming services--such as Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, etc.--and vMVPD services.

[In 2019 alone, 6.3 million people cut their cable connection, totaling 39.3 million. In a survey of what they might miss most from cable networks, 52% said they don’t miss anything, 23% missed live events on TV, 22% missed news, and 19% missed live sports](https://www.emarketer.com/content/most-cord-cutters-aren-t-missing-cable-tv)*.* Although not all of those that miss aspects of cable will pay for another subscription service, the sentiment exists for a sports-focused platform that offers other large networks as well.

[Another report by Parks Associates reveals that 17% of vMVPD subscribers switched from traditional TV within the last twelve months. In the same report, a survey conducted on current broadband households determined that 43% were “likely to switch to a… vMVPD within the next 12 months](https://www.broadbandtechreport.com/video/article/14196415/report-examines-vmvpd-sector-growth-in-broadband-pay-tv-market)*.""* The potential growth exists for the live digital broadcasting space, although it is slowing down.

With the spread of COVID and quarantines, people have been spending more time at home. When things open and quarantines end, that will be the true test for these providers as people will spend less time watching TV.

**The Sports Betting Sector**

Legal sports betting has taken a huge leap in recent years with the introduction of online sports betting; the ability to place wagers from anywhere at any time and have instant gratification has boomed with its slow legalization. [This sector has a forecasted value of $150 billion with other competitors already having a completed project and vast market share. In 2019, DraftKings ($DKNG) and FanDuel (PDYPY) controlled 83% of the market share](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/27/fanduel-draftkings-race-to-win-150-billion-sports-betting-market.html).

[FuboTV plans to join into this space with its own sportsbook. Their recent acquisition of Balto Sports in December of 2020, whose business was in simulating fantasy sports games, is Fubo’s first step into sports wagering. They plan to create a free-to-play gaming system alongside online sports wagering](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201201006185/en/fuboTV-Acquires-Balto-Sports-as-First-Step-Into-Online-Sports-Wagering-Market)*.*

[Their next planned acquisition, which was announced in January of 2021, will be to acquire Vigtory, a sports betting and interactive gaming company. According to BusinessWire, they plan to utilize Vigtory’s “sportsbook platform and digital gaming assets, and its consumer-driven betting technology, to develop a frictionless betting experience for fubo’s customers](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005596/en/fuboTV-Accelerates-Development-of-Sportsbook).""

These recent acquisitions set Fubo up to create an all-in-one viewing and betting experience, which could add new customers to their subscriber list and seal them into online wagering.

[It has been over two years since the Supreme Court has denied the federal ban on sports betting, which would have made online betting illegal in all of the United States. Currently, more than two dozen states have legalized sports betting, but most have only legalized in-person betting. More states may be willing to legalize to take advantage of the increased revenues and taxes associated with gambling and online wagering. As of 2020, six additional states plan to legalize some form of betting, although some are only allowing in-person. There are an additional 14 states that are considering the notion to allow legal gambling, whether in-person, online, or tribal](https://www.actionnetwork.com/news/legal-sports-betting-united-states-projections).

**Management and Investors**

David Gandler - CEO / Director / Co-Founder

Appointed as CEO and director in April of 2020. Prior to Fubo, Gandler had a 15 year career in marketing and advertising in local broadcast and cable TV within both general and Hispanic markets at companies such as Time Warner, Telemundo, and Scripps Networks Interactive.

Alberto Horihuela - CMO / Co-founder

In charge of marketing, Horihuela was head of Latin America for SVOD service DramaFever.

Simone Nardi - CFO

Nardi has worked as SVP and CFO of Scripps Networks Interactive where he was responsible for the finance and strategic planning for the company’s international business. Was also a key player in refinancing TVN S.A.’s billion dollar debt.

Large Investors

* Islet Management, LP with 5,108124 shares
* Morgan Stanley with 3,317,333 shares
* FMR LLC with 1,262,907 shares
* BlackRock Inc. with 956,678 shares
* Merger with FaceBank for $100 million revolving credit

**Analysts and Estimates**

Average analyst ratings put Fubo at a Buy to Strong Buy rating with an average price target of $45.50 with a high of $60 and a low of $30. EPS estimates are estimated to be -5.23 for 2020 and -1.64 for 2021.

Currently has a short float of about 75%, but the short volume has been holding at roughly 15-20% over the last month and has drastically declined from its October short volume of over 50%.

Originally valued at $700 million less than a year ago, a current valuation of $3.19 billion is respectable for this company and is on par for its current performance.

**Risks**

* Marketing fails and Fubo is never known as a household name, so consumers stick with other more known providers
* Their sportsbook fails and becomes dead weight and wasted money
* Subscriber count and streaming drops as quarantine lifts, reducing revenues while maintaining expenses
* Consumers opt for cheaper options
* People paying for the sports package cancel when the season is over, creating a boom and bust cycle if not managed correctly

**Final Thoughts / TL;DR**

With its drastic growth over the last year (400% in the last 4 months), support from FaceBank and well-known investors, and plans to join the sports betting sector, FuboTV has potential to become a household name and grow well beyond its current valuation by combining both sports broadcasting and online sports betting into one convenient place. Although unlikely to overthrow any of the current forces, it can become the best live sports broadcaster that people can turn to when they cut cable but want to keep live sports. It has many hurdles to overcome (creating their sportsbook, better marketing, increasing subscriber count, etc.) before it is any real competition to its already established competition.

At a $3.19 billion market cap and very high (75%) short interest, it will be very difficult to realize consistent growth, but it is on par for a company with almost $100 million in revenue.

**My Position**

25 shares at $47.30

lfmexh,20,49,StockMarket,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, February 8, 2021",0.93,1612848640.0,1612819840.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, February 8, 2021**

Stocks rose Monday, extending advances from last week’s rally as market participants continue to monitor developments in Washington surrounding additional fiscal stimulus. All three indices reached fresh record highs intraday. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.74%  up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.67% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.72% higher.

Optimism over an additional round of fiscal stimulus rose after a disappointing monthly jobs report last week. While the US economy resumed adding more jobs back than it lost in January, the number of jobs regained fell short of expectations, a sign that the economy might need a fiscal boost to gain momentum. Nonfarm payroll jobs rose 49,000 versus 105,000 expected by economists.  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CBS on Sunday the U.S. could return to full employment by 2022 – or two to three years ahead of some current projections – if measures in Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan were enacted.

Both the Senate and the House of Representatives voted to move forward to move forward with a process called reconciliation, which allows Democrats, who have a majority in both houses of Congress, to vote to pass Biden’s new coronavirus stimulus package without Republican votes. Reconciliation is a way for Congress to enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with only a majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires 60 votes to overcome. Because Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate—plus a Democratic vice president—reconciliation is a way to get a tax-and-spending bill to the president’s desk even if all 50 Republicans oppose it. 

President Biden defended his party’s actions by warning that efforts to pass a smaller bill would only prolong the suffering of many American families. He said, “I’d like to be doing it with the support of Republicans. I’ve met with Republicans ... but they’re just not willing to go as far as I think we have to go. If I have to choose between getting help right now to Americans who are hurting so badly, and being bogged down in a monthly negotiation or compromising on a bill that’s up to the crisis, it’s an easy choice.”

After reaching an all-time high on January 8, 2021, coronavirus infections have steadily decreased as the pace of vaccinations has increased, recently improving to over 1 million doses per day after President Biden’s administration allowed retail pharmacies like CVS to become vaccination sites. 

**Highlights**

* Companies including Lyft (LYFT), Uber (UBER), Twitter (TWTR), Coca-Cola (KO), Corsair (CRSR, and Roku (ROKU), and Disney (DIS) are poised to report quarterly results later this week.
* After Tesla (TSLA) revealed it purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and would soon accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment, Bitcoin (BTC) gapped up to reach all-time highs over $40,000. Dogecoin (DOGE) is another crypto receiving attention.
* Softbank (SFTBY) posted impressive earnings on the back of their Vision Fund, one of the largest investment funds in the world. After many high-profile failures in the previous years, the fund recovered after successful IPOs from Airbnb (ABNB) and DoorDash (DASH).

*****
> The prospects of a big government spending program could continue to boost the stock market and put upward pressure on interest rates in the week ahead.
*****
> Earnings season is beginning to wind down, but some big names have yet to report.
*****
> Walmart’s earnings on Thursday should provide a good window into the consumer, as should the government’s retail sales report for January, also expected Wednesday.
*****
> The Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon releases minutes from its last meeting, and investors will dig into those for any insight into the central bank’s view on inflation.
*****
> # Two dominant themes amid stimulus prospects
> Inflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law.
*****
> “The market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be. It’s going to be important. They can get it through reconciliation,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
> Krosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation, which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans.
*****
> Some in the markets had anticipated a package of $1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal, but that now looks unlikely. Strategists have changed their view on the proposed $1.9 trillion package.
*****
> “There is less pushback to President Biden’s proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected, so a price tag of around $1.5 trillion seems likely, which is higher than we initially thought,” noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts.
*****
> They say they expect a bill to come to the floor during the week of Feb. 22, and that it could become law by the first week of March. Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress.
*****
> Market pros expect the bigger the spending package, the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term. That has helped send Treasury yields, which move opposite price, to higher levels.
*****
> It has also increased concerns about inflation.
*****
> # Inflation and rising yields
In the past week, the 10-year yield — a key benchmark — touched 1.2% for the first time since March. It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday.
*****
> Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher.
*****
> “If you think about the big drivers, they’re related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. “If there’s more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.”
*****
> The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy.
*****
> At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target.
*****
> Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor.
*****
> “Because there’s such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we’ll see if that has eased,” she said.
*****
> “Obviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,” said Krosby.
*****
> Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January.
*****
> # Housing statistics
Housing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week.
*****
> The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales.
*****
> On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday.
*****
> Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes
Stocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934.
*****
> There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains.
*****
> Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily-shorted names.
*****
> Robinhood’s CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel.
*****
> The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market’s advance is intact.
*****
> “Overall, it’s a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,” Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad-based and there’s cyclical leadership.
*****
> “The low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,” said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week.
*****
> The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react.

> # Presidents' Day Seasonality

> The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents' Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington's birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents' Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President's Day through the Friday after, the S&P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents' week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week's end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.

> In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&P 500 during Presidents' Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.

> # Trading After Presidents’ Day Weekend Continues to be Weak

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/902779bf6e4c3920c0a6e594303d1963/f9c2be89a4714ce6-96/s500x750/313ae18652b5c66a140a47602ee5649c59baeee7.jpg))**

> In a recent post we looked at the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents’ Day weekend. However, the two days after still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of –0.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of –0.49% and a median loss of –0.11%.

> Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of –0.07% and a median decline of –0.10%. S&P 500 is down 18 of 31, average –0.02%, median –0.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average –0.01%, median –0.09%.

> # Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox

> “Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.

> The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs—it is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!

> Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn’t you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “The year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here’s hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!

> # Short Interest Update

> Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile's stock's median change in short interest from then to yesterday's release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png))**

> In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000's most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard's (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.

> On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png))**

> Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard's (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker's dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three—nCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)—now have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Decline.png))**

> Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png))**

> Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020. That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more. The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5.08% to 4.13%. Conversely, there are two industries, Banks and Materials, that have higher short interest as a percent of float than they did at the end of 2020.

# **Stimulus prospects could boost the stock market and interest rates in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/stimulus-prospects-could-boost-the-stock-market-and-interest-rates-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The prospects of a big government spending program could continue to boost the stock market and put upward pressure on interest rates in the week ahead.
*****
> Earnings season is beginning to wind down, but some big names have yet to report.
*****
> Walmart’s earnings on Thursday should provide a good window into the consumer, as should the government’s retail sales report for January, also expected Wednesday.
*****
> The Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon releases minutes from its last meeting, and investors will dig into those for any insight into the central bank’s view on inflation.
*****
> # Two dominant themes amid stimulus prospects
> Inflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law.
*****
> “The market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be. It’s going to be important. They can get it through reconciliation,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
> Krosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation, which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans.
*****
> Some in the markets had anticipated a package of $1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal, but that now looks unlikely. Strategists have changed their view on the proposed $1.9 trillion package.
*****
> “There is less pushback to President Biden’s proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected, so a price tag of around $1.5 trillion seems likely, which is higher than we initially thought,” noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts.
*****
> They say they expect a bill to come to the floor during the week of Feb. 22, and that it could become law by the first week of March. Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress.
*****
> Market pros expect the bigger the spending package, the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term. That has helped send Treasury yields, which move opposite price, to higher levels.
*****
> It has also increased concerns about inflation.
*****
> # Inflation and rising yields
In the past week, the 10-year yield — a key benchmark — touched 1.2% for the first time since March. It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday.
*****
> Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher.
*****
> “If you think about the big drivers, they’re related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. “If there’s more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.”
*****
> The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy.
*****
> At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target.
*****
> Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor.
*****
> “Because there’s such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we’ll see if that has eased,” she said.
*****
> “Obviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,” said Krosby.
*****
> Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January.
*****
> # Housing statistics
Housing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week.
*****
> The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales.
*****
> On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday.
*****
> Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes
Stocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934.
*****
> There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains.
*****
> Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily-shorted names.
*****
> Robinhood’s CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel.
*****
> The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market’s advance is intact.
*****
> “Overall, it’s a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,” Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad-based and there’s cyclical leadership.
*****
> “The low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,” said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week.
*****
> The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react.

> # Presidents' Day Seasonality

> The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents' Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington's birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents' Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President's Day through the Friday after, the S&P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents' week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week's end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day3f.png))**

> In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&P 500 during Presidents' Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.

> # Trading After Presidents’ Day Weekend Continues to be Weak

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/902779bf6e4c3920c0a6e594303d1963/f9c2be89a4714ce6-96/s500x750/313ae18652b5c66a140a47602ee5649c59baeee7.jpg))**

> In a recent post we looked at the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents’ Day weekend. However, the two days after still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of –0.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of –0.49% and a median loss of –0.11%.

> Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of –0.07% and a median decline of –0.10%. S&P 500 is down 18 of 31, average –0.02%, median –0.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average –0.01%, median –0.09%.

> # Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox

> “Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.

> The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs—it is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!

> Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn’t you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “The year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here’s hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!

> # Short Interest Update

> Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile's stock's median change in short interest from then to yesterday's release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png))**

> In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000's most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard's (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.

> On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png))**

> Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard's (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker's dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three—nCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)—now have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Decline.png))**

> Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png))**

> Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020. That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more. The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5.08% to 4.13%. Conversely, there are two industries, Banks and Materials, that have higher short interest as a percent of float than they did at the end of 2020.

#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-19-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow futures bounce after biggest one-day February loss

> * U.S. stock futures rose Friday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their biggest one-day losses in the red-hot month of February. The Dow, which broke a three-day winning streak and fell from a record closing high, remained on track for a positive week, which would be its third straight. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are riding three-day losing streaks and are on pace for their first losing weeks in the past three.

> * B/itcoin — which topped $52,000 this week — hit another all-time high early Friday near $53,000 per unit. After Tesla and other companies recently showed support for the world’s biggest c/ryptocurrency, major financial firms also appeared to be warming to it. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Thursday she believes b/itcoin is a “highly speculative asset.”

*****

> # 2. Treasury Secretary Yellen pushes for major Covid stimulus

> * As the House aims to pass its version of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief blueprint by the end of next week, Yellen told CNBC that a large stimulus package is necessary to get the economy back to full strength. “The price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big,” she said.” We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run.” Democrats hope to get their bill through Congress before March 14, when key federal jobless benefit programs expire.

*****

> # 3. Biden to pledge billions in global Covid vaccination aid

> * Biden is expected to announce Friday that the U.S. will spend $4 billion on international Covid vaccination efforts. He will make the pledge during his first virtual meeting as president with G-7 leaders. Biden will also urge other nations to put more money toward the global fight against the pandemic.

> * Later in the day, Biden travels to Michigan to visit Pfizer’s vaccine manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, a trip that was supposed to happen Thursday but was postponed due winter weather. Biden made his first domestic trip as president Tuesday, traveling to Wisconsin for a CNN town hall on the coronavirus.

*****

> # 4. Uber dealt a major blow as UK’s top court rules drivers are workers

> * Shares of Uber dropped another 3% in the premarket after the Supreme Court in the U.K. ruled Friday that the company’s drivers there should be classified as workers rather than independent contractors. The ruling out of Britain ends an almost five-year legal battle between Uber and a group of former drivers there. Uber insists its drivers are self-employed and that it acts as more of an “agency” that connects them with passengers through an app. The company weathered a challenge in its home market of California in November, when voters backed a ballot proposal that cemented app-based food delivery and ride-hailing drivers’ status as independent contractors, not employees.

*****

> # 5. Citadel’s Ken Griffin defends controversial Wall Street practice

> * During Thursday’s GameStop hearing, Citadel’s Ken Griffin defended a controversial method brokerages use to make money, and said his firm would adapt if new regulations prohibited the practice. Members of Congress spent much of their time prodding about “payment for order flow,” a practice in which a brokerage receives payment from a market maker like Citadel, known as a dealer, for directing the order to them. This model is how Robinhood and other brokers are able to offer commission-free trading. “I do believe that payment for order flow has been an important source of innovation in the industry,” Griffin added.

lojy2s,165,40,wallstreetbets,"ARKK gamma squeeze, low IV and premium. Cathie has potentially set herself up for a major correction after the last massive years run.",0.63,1613893604.0,1613864804.0,"Alright BEAR with me kids as this is a lot to read(TLDR: buy ARKK puts) but as Jay Z told Rick Rubin, ‘You crazy for this one!’. I think I found a bubble within a bubble thats easier to gain on with the right catalyst.

Gamma squeezing ARKK is no simple task but the IV and premiums on the ETF are prime for some major tendies. I'm still building up the idea but I don't know if it's possible just due to the 'aunt Cathie' crowd. However, I decided to start a position on Friday and take one for the team.

Looking through ARKK weight on their top holds for the ETF, especially CRSP, PSTG, and NVTA could setup for major drop on certain tickers. 

CRSP they own 8.58% of open float and its 3.17% of their ETF
Short float is 4.60%

PSTG they own 7.86% of open float and its 2.04% of their ETF
Short float is 6.3%

NVTA they own 9.08% of open float and its 3.09% of their ETF
Short float is  16.26%

Other tickers that they own way to much of the float are PRLB(11.53%),IOVA(7.67%), TWST(6.80%), NTLA(10.90%), TWOU(11.65%), PD(9.37%), MTLS(10.75%), EDIT(10.62%), VCYT(7.23%), IRDM(5.49%), SSYS(12.05%), MCRB(9.54%), CERS(11.35%), CGEN(11.96%), SYRS(10.95%)

Large cap equities that stick out to me as a potential issue to front load their ETF on a pullback are TSLA, ROKU, SQ, TDOC, BIDU, SPOT, and Z where the current percentage of these equities in their ETF makes up 36.75% of their weight. I know they maintain the average weight of TSLA from 8-12% depending on the price action in order to maintain an average of 10% of the total ETF.

Though I'm not overly concerned with the weight of any major equity within their ETF, I am a bit concerned with the weight of the overall open float for many of their holdings. With a small correction in the tech and bio bubble they will definitely be the front runner in dumping.

The reason I am looking at ARKK in anticipation of a correction is that the IV and premium of puts is insanely low in comparison to the individual equities. It's hard to bet against ARKK since its cult like, but this is staying on my radar

I put together a table of the current shares on Friday close for ARKK that includes ARKK % of the float that they currently hold for the individual equity in their ETF and I highlight a few other key components such as Previous day average range, short float %, and ARKK current weight for each equity within their ETF.

After opening the day higher, stocks pulled back throughout the session to finish in the red, closing out a very volatile week in the stock market. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.17% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed 0.44% down, and the Dow (DIA) closed 0.03% down. Even though the major indexes pulled back this week, they continue to hover near record levels as optimism over additional stimulus continues to fuel higher levels of risk tolerance among market participants. 

There are many encouraging developments surrounding the coronavirus. This week, the United States averaged 77,665 new coronavirus cases per day, a drop of 43% from the average of two weeks ago, according to data analyzed by the New York Times. Furthermore, [analysis from Bloomberg on Thursday ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/how-many-vaccine-doses-are-available-u-s-should-see-a-surge?srnd=premium)showed that the U.S. vaccine supply is poised to double from the current rate of 10 million to 15 million doses per week within the next few weeks, allowing more shots to be given in the near-term.

Thursday night, in an interview with CNBC, Treasury Secretary Yellen said a large stimulus package is still necessary to build up sufficient momentum for economic recovery to take off on its own. She said, “We think it’s very important to have a big package \[that\] addresses the pain this has caused – 15 million Americans behind on their rent, 24 million adults and 12 million children who don’t have enough to eat, small businesses failing. I think the price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big. We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run,” she added.” 

Despite a record low supply and a temporary pullback in December, the housing market remains very strong. According to a report by the National Association of Realtors, sales ended the month of January at a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 6.69 million units. That figure is 0.6 higher than December and 23.7% higher when compared with January 2020 and the second-highest sales pace since April 2006.

Roku, Deere & Twilio smash earnings expectations while Walmart disappoints. Palantir sells off on mixed results, so let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw a mixed week for the major indexes with the [Dow](https://imgur.com/VX5S1v3) gained just 0.11% for the week, while the [SP500](https://imgur.com/1uJLQIX) lost 0.7% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/5ZVNdNg) underperformed losing over 1.5% after the treasury interest rate rose sharply to start the week.

7 of the 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/xiLEGrH) finished the week in the red, while Utilities losing over 2%, while Energy & Financials hugely outperformed.

This stock market movement also pushed the Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/uEyhkQu) up over 9% in the past week as it rose over 20 yet again.

[Here](https://imgur.com/kPFpl23) is the HEAT MAP from last week, that shows a pretty divided picture, with Technology, Communications & Cyclicals losing ground, while the gainers were concentrated in just a couple of sectors.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, with the January core retail [sales](https://imgur.com/IbeU1ck) up almost 6%, with the Producer price [INDEX](https://imgur.com/ZocPeJs) also rose by 1.3%, its largest spike since it started being recorded.

So given this numbers, and what the [FED](https://imgur.com/kpGprlk) leaders have continued to tell us, it’s very likely we won’t see a sustained inflation rate of at least 2% in the next year or two, despite this huge numbers coming in on the economic side. It’s really hard to see how this numbers can continue to come in at such high levels once we move on to a more normal life, even with another round of stimulus checks.

The other beat on the economic numbers came in from the [PMI](https://imgur.com/Hrk5SZQ) composite, which signaled the fastest growth in 6 years while in terms of Jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/sEbFcJ2), we saw a spike in numbers yet again for the week, but the continuing claims manage to drop by more than 50K.

We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://imgur.com/MUk8Vv2), which showed yet again an increase in bullishness, which is starting to get very dangerous for the stock market as I said in my previous posts. The bullishness is nearing the 50% which we haven’t seen since after the November elections, so yet again, I would pretty much hold my portfolio right now, not selling but not buying much right now either, as this has worked as a good contrarian indicator in the past.

This [week](https://imgur.com/ZPdkzS5) we get some more economic data, with the leading economic indicators, the consumer confidence index, the jobless numbers and consumer spending, while on the [earnings](https://imgur.com/IAIyHIf) front, we are moving towards the end of the earnings seasons with interesting names like Square, Nvidia, Moderna, Etsy, DraftKings & many others reporting this upcoming week.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Ford](https://imgur.com/9X9cqJH) continuing their journey on becoming fully electric by 2030 as they will invest $1B in their production facility from Germany. This news, combined with [GM](https://imgur.com/SGIF2TL) and most other traditional OEM joining more & more the EV sector will continue to add pressure to the hyped stocks like Tesla, Nio, Xpeng & many others. I believe there will be a lot of companies that will benefit from this move, but not all will succeed, so you have to watch out and do your DD on what companies you pick & chose. I think we will see a mixed bag in the future with a couple of hyped stocks like Tesla which just cut the [price](https://imgur.com/tIxgkLk) of the model 3 and Y again & Nio remaining favorites while I expect OEMs to eat up some of the other new entrants.

On the earnings side, we had [Palantir](https://imgur.com/EHDqE9f) reporting a beat on revenues, with the stock selling off pretty steeply after that report, despite an in-line [guidance](https://imgur.com/ExRQ4DD) for the revenue growth of about 30% for 2021, with a big growth rate in the first quarter of the year. It didn’t help the stock that the lock-up period of 80% of the remaining insider shares also expired, but I think this was an interesting buying opportunity for Palantir if you are looking to hold the company for the long-term, as it already started to recover, rising more than 15% on [Friday](https://imgur.com/TDBDIpw), after the [ARK](https://imgur.com/H8m7HBn) Innovation ETF added over 5M shares.

[Twilio](https://imgur.com/qhbS8Ln) also rose after beating both the top & bottom line and impressed with a guidance well above the consensus, though they followed this with a stock [offering](https://imgur.com/JALCaI5) of over $1.5B which caused somewhat of a small correction after the big pop.

One other stock that also rose after the earnings reports was [ROKU](https://imgur.com/j5gA32i), as the company posted a surprise profit while their revenues increased almost 60% over last year. They also expect an adjusted EBITDA of around 5-10% for 2021, moving the company into profitability finally.

But guys, the biggest beat on expectations by far in my opinion this week came from the industrial giant [Deere](https://imgur.com/qoXEacL), rising to a new record high for the stock as they beat expectations by $1.70 and increased their revenues by over 20% over last year, as they also [guided](https://imgur.com/OgcZT2b) for net income of up to $5B next year, compared to $2.75B in FY2020.

On the other hand, [Walmart](https://imgur.com/E2a8iOr) dropped 6% after reporting a miss on earnings for the 4th quarter while also giving a soft guidance for next year, though they did announce a $20B buyback plan and a raise of the dividend yield. I think the drop might have also been cause by the news they would increase employee wages with at least 12months of history in the company to $15/hours from the current $11/hour, which will affect their earnings in the future.

So yeah folks, let’s hope for a better week in the stock markets again!

lprws6,47,37,investing,NVDA ER and ARK Invest point to more upside for NVIDIA,0.84,1614038278.0,1614009478.0,"Nvidia  reports earnings for FY21 Wednesday the 24th.  Analysts are expecting  revenue of $4.8B and EPS of $2.80.   My expectation is closer to  $5.1-$5.2B and EPS and $3+ for the Quarter.  Nvidia has topped revenue  estimates 10 of the last 12 quarters and beat profit estimates in 11 of  the last 12.   Demand remains high and the company has indicated their  gaming segment is already sold out through Q1.

The  blog below has an interesting take on the overlap of these two  companies.    It describes how NVIDIA’s technology covers every single  point in ARK Invest’s 2021 “Big Ideas” presentation.   I really doubt  there is another “disruptively innovating” company making such an impact  against their ""big ideas.""   Certainly ARK’s #1 holding TSLA, isn’t  anywhere near significant to their future as NVDA, let alone the others  rounding out their top 5: Square, Teledoc, Roku or Baidu.

The  mysterious part is NVDA is one of ARK’s smaller holdings.   All NVDA  shares in the three ARK funds they’re held in make up only 0.5% of all  assets in ARK’s actively managed funds.   Counter intuitive.

ARK  has started buying NVDA more prominently in late Dec.   With positive  earnings and a big fund acquiring looks like there could be plenty of  upside in NVDA.

I believe there will be a lot of companies that will benefit from this move, but not all will succeed, so you have to watch out and do your DD on what companies you pick & chose. I think we will see a mixed bag in the future with a couple of hyped stocks like Tesla which just cut the [price](https://imgur.com/tIxgkLk) of the model 3 and Y again & Nio remaining favorites while I expect OEMs to eat up some of the other new entrants.🚀🚀🚀

On the earnings side, we had [Palantir](https://imgur.com/EHDqE9f) reporting a beat on revenues, with the stock selling off pretty steeply after that report, despite an in-line [guidance](https://imgur.com/ExRQ4DD) for the revenue growth of about 30% for 2021, with a big growth rate in the first quarter of the year. It didn’t help the stock that the lock-up period of 80% of the remaining insider shares also expired, but I think this was an interesting buying opportunity for Palantir if you are looking to hold the company for the long-term, as it already started to recover, rising more than 15% on [Friday](https://imgur.com/TDBDIpw), after the [ARK](https://imgur.com/H8m7HBn) Innovation ETF added over 5M shares.🚀🚀🚀

[Twilio](https://imgur.com/qhbS8Ln) also rose after beating both the top & bottom line and impressed with a guidance well above the consensus, though they followed this with a stock [offering](https://imgur.com/JALCaI5) of over $1.5B which caused somewhat of a small correction after the big pop.🚀🚀

One other stock that also rose after the earnings reports was [ROKU](https://imgur.com/j5gA32i), as the company posted a surprise profit while their revenues increased almost 60% over last year. They also expect an adjusted EBITDA of around 5-10% for 2021, moving the company into profitability finally.🚀🚀🚀

But guys, the biggest beat on expectations by far in my opinion this week came from the industrial giant [Deere](https://imgur.com/qoXEacL), rising to a new record high for the stock as they beat expectations by $1.70 and increased their revenues by over 20% over last year, as they also [guided](https://imgur.com/OgcZT2b) for net income of up to $5B next year, compared to $2.75B in FY2020. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

On the other hand, [Walmart](https://imgur.com/E2a8iOr) dropped 6% after reporting a miss on earnings for the 4th quarter while also giving a soft guidance for next year, though they did announce a $20B buyback plan and a raise of the dividend yield. I think the drop might have also been cause by the news they would increase employee wages with at least 12months of history in the company to $15/hours from the current $11/hour, which will affect their earnings in the future.

So yeah folks, let’s hope for a better week in the stock markets again!

lpkn8q,2,22,StockMarket,Weekly Stock Market News | ROKU / TWLO / WMT /PLTR / DE / F & other Stock Market News [02-22],0.92,1614017852.0,1613989052.0,"**The stock market cools of as technology drops after the treasury yields spike. Roku, Deere & Twilio smash earnings expectations while Walmart disappoints. Palantir sells off on mixed results, so let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw a mixed week for the major indexes with the [Dow](https://imgur.com/VX5S1v3) gained just 0.11% for the week, while the [SP500](https://imgur.com/1uJLQIX) lost 0.7% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/5ZVNdNg) underperformed losing over 1.5% after the treasury interest rate rose sharply to start the week.

7 of the 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/xiLEGrH) finished the week in the red, while Utilities losing over 2%, while Energy & Financials hugely outperformed.

This stock market movement also pushed the Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/uEyhkQu) up over 9% in the past week as it rose over 20 yet again.

[Here](https://imgur.com/kPFpl23) is the HEAT MAP from last week, that shows a pretty divided picture, with Technology, Communications & Cyclicals losing ground, while the gainers were concentrated in just a couple of sectors.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, with the January core retail [sales](https://imgur.com/IbeU1ck) up almost 6%, with the Producer price [INDEX](https://imgur.com/ZocPeJs) also rose by 1.3%, its largest spike since it started being recorded.

So given this numbers, and what the [FED](https://imgur.com/kpGprlk) leaders have continued to tell us, it’s very likely we won’t see a sustained inflation rate of at least 2% in the next year or two, despite this huge numbers coming in on the economic side. It’s really hard to see how this numbers can continue to come in at such high levels once we move on to a more normal life, even with another round of stimulus checks.

The other beat on the economic numbers came in from the [PMI](https://imgur.com/Hrk5SZQ) composite, which signaled the fastest growth in 6 years while in terms of Jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/sEbFcJ2), we saw a spike in numbers yet again for the week, but the continuing claims manage to drop by more than 50K.

We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://imgur.com/MUk8Vv2), which showed yet again an increase in bullishness, which is starting to get very dangerous for the stock market as I said in my previous posts. The bullishness is nearing the 50% which we haven’t seen since after the November elections, so yet again, I would pretty much hold my portfolio right now, not selling but not buying much right now either, as this has worked as a good contrarian indicator in the past.

This [week](https://imgur.com/ZPdkzS5) we get some more economic data, with the leading economic indicators, the consumer confidence index, the jobless numbers and consumer spending, while on the [earnings](https://imgur.com/IAIyHIf) front, we are moving towards the end of the earnings seasons with interesting names like Square, Nvidia, Moderna, Etsy, DraftKings & many others reporting this upcoming week.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Ford](https://imgur.com/9X9cqJH) continuing their journey on becoming fully electric by 2030 as they will invest $1B in their production facility from Germany.

Which stocks and ETFs do you think are going to be big this year?

Which sectors will you be paying most attention to?

Which sectors and/or securities will you be avoiding at all costs?

Do you think the crazy run for securities like ARK ETFs, FNGU ETN, TQQQ, FANG stocks, etc. will continue?

Are you excited about any stocks that you think will 2x or 3x this year like Roku, Twilio, and others did last year?

Do you think any of the big tech companies (e.g. Apple, Nvidia, Google, Microsoft, etc.) will have a chance at 2x this year?",2021-02-23

Now a lot of sites compare it to Roku but not as significant. If betting integration went well they could do really well but now a class action lawsuit is filed against them. Also, they're not currently a profitable company.

That being said, analyst price forecasts have been playing catch-up so it's hard to say as it's always been volatile. It has dropped a lot today but that could just be a reaction. I'm tempted to buy in again lower to lower my average but not doing that I feel is a mental rule to stick with. What do you guys think?

lsx6yt,34,28,stocks,Friday 26 February 2021: A discount bot I have created.,0.67,1614373150.0,1614344350.0,"Friday 26 February 2021

*Live Updates*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help Reddit. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.

**Key:**

* Penny stocks are very risky.
* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

This is one of my first posts and am going to try to make this a weekly thing to help you apes and autists out. 

Hedgefunds and asset management firms have these analysts preparing all these market forecasts all the time. I feel like us apes could come together to defeat the hedgies by putting all our thoughts together and getting a sense of how the market might look like in the near future. So we can get tendies! Who wants tendies? I want tendies!

Please note this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. I am just an ape. This is purely for education purpose. Please consult a financial advisor not me.

You all must be wondering, what the hell is going on in the market lately? Why are stonks down? Where are my tendies?

Well Apes, apparently there are these things called bonds. JPOW sells these things at auctions and people buy them! Can you believe it? People actually buy things other than stonks.

Lately these bond traders have been very worried that things are getting back to normal! There's $1.9 trillion on its way and that means tendies! Tendies for everyone! And that means prices of things might go up. And if that happens then Fed might have to raise interest rates to keep the prices from getting out of control!

These genuis bond traders have ultra paper hands and they were expecting rates to rise in 2023. But they are afriad they might go up in 2022! Oh lawd! Have mercy.

If interest rates go up. It means stonks go down! Witchcraft! These bond traders are scared and pooping their pants. No one is buying, which is driving the prices of some of these bonds down. means yields are rising! Rising yields oh no!  Everyone is panicking and cashing out.

So bond traders are all looking at JPOW like what you gonna do. You gonna keep running that printer or stop? JPOW is like. Whatever YOLO. But bond traders are not convinced. They feel like JPOW like a cheating boyfriend is lying and will probably backstab them and raise rates.

So bond traders don't wknow what to do. They are panicking. Scared and running around like chickens without heads. All this fear is spreading into the stock market and people are selling their stocks.

Stocks are down! Stocks are down! Stocks are down!

So what's ahead? Well Feb's job report is out on FRIDAY. If the numbers look good Thats Bad! Good means bad because it means things are getting back to normal. No! Bond traders don't want things to get back to normal. If numbers are bad Thats good! Because that means less risk of higher rates.

Good is bad and bad is Good!  What in the world is going on?!?

Well - All you need to know is JPOW is speaking on Thursday. Everyone will be watching. If he says something stupid... Stonks will go down. So lets hope he doesn't say anything stupid. Job reports out on Friday. If report is good then more red! 

Also - Expect some more red if bond traders panic a bit more and drag the stocks down. If there is fear in the market then fewer insitutions will buy stuff. Apes are still buying. So keep buying and keep holding those diamond hands. Don't paper hand! Hold Strong! Let the insitution paper hand. If we keep holding. The market will stabilize in the next week or so. If we buy that means more tendies.

All the best Apes. Just remember, expect turbulence ahead. But it will pass in a week or so. As soon as those stimulus cheques hit the streets, there will be tendies! Glorious tendies.

lx6y06,43,71,stocks,The case for inflation: Simple math in layman's terms,0.86,1614841883.0,1614813083.0,"Hi team,

I had a lot of traction with my previous post on $ARKK so I thought I would lay out a very simple case as to why, in my view and others, we may experience more inflation in the coming years than the US has experienced in the last 50 years, and the potential implications of such a scenario.

**********************

The math is simple and it relies on two basic concepts from Macroeconomics 101:

1. M2 Money Supply - this is an estimate published by the Federal Reserve that approximates dollars in circulation (and things like savings accounts, money market funds, and other sources that are liquid and can behave like cash)

2. M2 Velocity of Money - Also published by the Fed, this seeks to estimate the number of times that each dollar in M2 exchanges hands over the course of the year (turnover)

The equation linking these two concepts to Gross Domestic Product is quite simple as well.

M2 Money Supply x M2 Velocity = Nominal Gross Domestic Product (NGDP)

**********************

What we saw throughout 2020, as a result of the pandemic and the fiscal and monetary policies that followed, was a substantial increase in money supply (stimulus) and a substantial decrease in the velocity of money (stay-at-home orders). Based on our simple equation, these factors mostly offset each other and therefore were not visibly inflationary.

1. From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, M2 money supply increased from $15.1 trillion to $19.4 trillion (+28%) Note: Fastest growth rate since WWII

2. From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, M2 velocity declined from 1.4 to 1.1 (-21%)

Plugging into our equation:

Year-end 2019: 1.4 x $15.1T = $21.14T annualized nominal GDP

Year-end 2020: 1.1 x $19.4T = $21.34T annualized nominal GDP

This represents a change in NGDP of just 1%! No inflation!

**********************

What happens next? Some of you have already gotten vaccines, others have already been sick and developed immunity. States have recently announced reopening completely, and national case counts are showing relatively steep declines as we approach vaccination and illness-induced herd immunity.

What does this mean? Consumer spending habits are changing. Record high savings rates and savings balances are likely to revert to normal. We'll take vacations, go to concerts, eat out at restaurants, etc - all things we haven't been able to do for the last 12 months.

This means a recovery in M2 velocity but with a new much higher base of money.

**********************

Let's look back at our equation and make a few assumptions about the recovery of velocity.

***Scenario 1: Velocity recovers to pre-COVID level at end of 2019***

1.4 x $19.4T = $27.16T NGDP (+27% compared with year-end 2020)

***Scenario 2: Velocity recovers and overshoots the pre-COVID level, say to the trailing 10-year average velocity of 1.5***

1.5 x $19.4T =$29.1T NGDP (+36% compared with year-end 2020)

***Scenario 3: Inflation becomes widely recognized and consumers/investors look for alternatives to holding cash, velocity spikes to the highest it has been in 10 years at 1.75 and inflation feeds on itself***

1.75 x $19.4T = $33.95T NGDP (+59% compared with year-end 2020)

**********************

It is likely that this inflation will be spread out over more than a year, but the key question at hand is:

*""How long will it take for the price level to reflect all of this new money in the system and how long will it take for velocity to fully recover (or overshoot)?""*

In each scenario, even if it took 2-3 years we are talking about ***double digit annualized inflation rates...*** 

*AND THAT IS BEFORE WE SEE THE IMPACT ON MONEY SUPPLY AND VELOCITY FROM YET MORE GOVERNMENT STIMULUS CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED IN CONGRESS.*

Inflation rates may be *much higher* than the figures outlined above... and despite all of this the Federal Reserve continues to say that they see no inflation, that they are content to keep short-term interest rates at zero until 2023 or later. Asleep at the wheel if you ask me.

**********************

What does it mean for r/stocks and your investment portfolio? In a nutshell:

1. Nominal interest rates are likely to rise, commodity prices (oil) will increase, real estate values will increase (REITs), the prices of all *real assets* will increase.

2. Companies that are able to index their revenues to inflation (pricing power!) will be able to defend their earnings, while others will see input costs skyrocket and revenues fail to keep up.

3. The equity markets are going to be volatile, with winners and losers. Companies that are highly leveraged and don't have pricing power may go bankrupt when they need to refinance debts at higher rates.

4. Other companies with pricing power, low variable costs, or durable intellectual property will be huge winners.

5. Tech/growth stocks that trade at obscenely rich valuation and who promise real profits years or decades into the future are going to get smashed. These so called ""long-duration"" equities, many of which are favorites on r/stocks and r/wallstreetbets, even if they survive, may go from trading at 25-50x trailing revenues (on zero net income) to 5-10x revenue or less - examples: SHOP trades at 50x trailing revenues and 470x trailing earnings, ROKU trades at 27x trailing revenue on *negative earnings*. 

6. In relation to point 5, inflation-driven equity volatility is likely to result in *higher equity risk premiums*, or higher discount rates on forecasted growth. 

7. Those with fixed rate debt (e.g. 30-year fixed mortgages) will be well-protected as home prices appreciate and the dollars owed to the bank depreciate.

8. Those on fixed incomes and those who hold cash balances will be punished by inflation. Those who are unable to see their wages increase with inflation (American middle class) will see their quality of life decline. Inflation will punish those without real assets, those on fixed income pensions, and those who save their cash. There's a whole other discussion about income and wealth inequality in here but we'll leave that for another day.

lxmf50,24,39,wallstreetbets,$PUBM - Secular Tailwinds & High % Short,0.75,1614898882.0,1614870082.0,"Let me tell you all about a little company called Pubmatic $PUBM.

**TLDR;**

\- Secular Tailwinds in Programmatic Advertising Space & Connected TV - Very Good- Solid Financials - Very Good- Valuation - UNDERVALUED LIKE CRAZY- Short Interest - Someone look it up, but it's anywhere from 30-80%**- Good Industry + Solid Financials + Undervalued + High Short Interest = VERY GOOD**

**INTRODUCTION**

Pubmatic is in the programmatic advertising space and is a supply-side platform (SSP) where it works with publishers to maximize their advertising revenue and if you don't know much about that space, let me tell you about three other companies that have benefited tremendously from the secular tailwinds in this space: The Trade Desk ($TTD), Magnite ($MGNI), Acuity Ads ($ACUIF)

The Trade Desk, Magnite, Acuity Ads have all benefited tremendously from the big shift to programmatic advertising (bunch of ads that show up on various websites based on your interests) and most of all: Connected Television (CTV) where legacy cable advertisers are shifting their ad dollars to move into digital advertising within televisions (i.e. Hulu, Roku, IMDB, etc.).

There are **BIG dollars moving from legacy TV to digital TV and traditional advertising to programmatic advertising.**

Just look at their stock prices in the past 1 year/3-years:

TTD: 150% / 1,122%MGNI: 317% / 2502%ACUIF: 1390% / 1454%

Anyway going back to Pubmatic. This little company IPO'd in December 2020 and basically for most of December didn't have much movement in their stock price unlike our little friends above who saw their stock prices skyrocket in the month of December.

Then come January and February Pubmatic started getting some traction as investors started realizing Pubmatic's potential in this space, but the real reckoning came when they announced earnings on February 23 where they not only beat earnings, THEY **CRUSHED earnings** and they did one even better, they gave **SOLID guidance for Q1** and FY 2021 despite having little visibility into the back half of 2021.

**FINANCIALS**

&#x200B;

|Revenue (In $ Ms)||||||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||Q1|Q2|Q3|Q4|Total|
|2018|||||$99.3|
|2019|$23.6|$27.4|$28.5|$34.4|$113.9|
|2020|$28.3|$26.4|$37.8|$56.2|$148.7|
|2021|$38-40|||||

&#x200B;

|Revenue % YoY|Q1|Q2|Q3|Q4|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 vs. 2019|19.9%|\-3.7%|32.6%|**63.4%**|
|2021 vs. 2020|**41.3%**||||

Look at that Revenue **ACCELERATION** from 19.9% to 63.4% by Q4 and guiding for 41.3% which they will easily beat by at least a few points if not more (most companies guide with some padding).

**They are also GAAP PROFITABLE**. Most tech companies are Non-GAAP profitable due to stock-based compensation which cuts into earnings, but this little company is PROFITABLE already.

Their Net Income Margin for Q4 was 33.5% which is incredible and for the year they finished with a 17.9% Net Income Margin despite COVID beating the crap out of this business in Q2.

This is a company that is executing brilliantly and has done so profitability as well. They also have really happy employees and a bunch of reviews too: [https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PubMatic-Reviews-E256835.htm](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/PubMatic-Reviews-E256835.htm)

**VALUATION**

When it comes to tech companies, given their lack of GAAP profitability, they are often valued on an Enterprise Value to Sales ratio (EV/S).

&#x200B;

|Company Name|TTM EV/S|Q4 Growth Rate|Q1 Guidance|Market Cap|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|The Trade Desk|44.8|\+48%|\+35%|$37.8 B|
|Magnite|26.1|20% (Pro Forma)|\+20-40% (Pro-forma)|$5.9 B|
|Pubmatic|**18**|\+63.4%|\+41.3%|$2.6 B|

Pubmatic is growing significantly faster than The Trade Desk and Magnite and has a multiple that is at least 30%+ less. This makes no sense! How is a company growing faster than its peers that offers a product that has a ton of traction, and executing brilliantly valued so much less? If they were to get an equal multiple, this stock would be trading in the $90+ range at least.

**SHORT INTEREST & VOLUME**

Now it gets interesting. I have no idea if the sources I'm reviewing are correct, but this is what I'm seeing:

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PUBM&ty=c&ta=1&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PUBM&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)

It shows % Short Float at **32.2%** which seems like a lot to me.

Another article per TheStreet.com shows short float % at: **80.3%!!!!**

[https://www.thestreet.com/investing/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-by-float-shorted-amc-pubmatic-tanger-gamestop-gogo?puc=yahoo&cm\_ven=YAHOO](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-by-float-shorted-amc-pubmatic-tanger-gamestop-gogo?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO)

I have no idea which source is correct, all I know is this stock is incredibly volatile despite solid results. Perhaps it's due to it being a new IPO or something, but the stock skyrocketed to $76 before cratering down to $52 due to the recent market volatility and I wouldn't doubt that the high % short float, whatever it is, is causing that to some degree.

Regardless, it does seem like a prime candidate for a potential short squeeze. If $RKT could double with a short float % of 38% or so and it being a $30 B company prior to the squeeze, I would anticipate a company that is < $3 B in market cap and doesn't have a ton of trading volume everyday, could see some potential uptick.

**Wrapping Up**

I think Pubmatic is a great company. They seem to be executing flawlessly and are guiding for continued strength and are in an industry with HUGE secular tailwinds. I anticipate this company will do very well by its own, but given how much short interest there is, this could be an interesting play too.

If you had watched my Youtube video on shorting the market then you knew exactly what to do to make money yesterday. Today the SPY is gapping down into the 50 day ma and trying to hold pre market. Tons of gap downs pre market compared to gap ups and many charts look weak, however, we have sold off now for a few days and could catch a bounce. Be prepared to trade both short and long today, to capitalize on the volatility. If you are new to trading, you may want to sit this one out as today may be difficult and not every day is a good day to trade. I will be continuing to focus on earnings plays as there are some good charts today. Good luck trading.

The Dow Jones (DIA) gained close to 1% while the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) is officially in correction territory, falling more than 10% from its recent highs. 

Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. 

The prospect of a strong economic recovery post-pandemic, enabled by the rollout of vaccines and supportive fiscal and monetary policy, have simultaneously pushed estimates for growth higher while stoking fears of inflation. As a result, Treasury yields have turned sharply higher, hovering near 1.6%,  making bonds more attractive and capital more expensive to borrow. Rising yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies generate most of their revenue and earnings years down the road. The future value of that capital decreases in today’s dollar value as the yield increases. As a result, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-flying stocks that led 2020 into stocks that will benefit from economic reopening.

The ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which counts Tesla as its top holding by market value, has plunged by 22% over the past two weeks, as Tesla and other high-flying tech names like Square and Roku gave back some of their 2020 gains. This was the best performing ETF last year.

m0z7bv,92,26,stocks,Buy the dip growth candidates,0.83,1615294654.0,1615265854.0,"Hey y'all,

As the market transitions out of growth and tech stocks and into value, I want to position myself appropriately. these same stocks that have gone done 20-30% in the past two weeks are the same stocks that every wanted to buy a month ago, touted by Wall Street analysts but didn't due to valuation and recent growth fallacy. If you could pick a handful of high growth companies to buy and hold for the next few years, which would they be? Looking back on the March dip, it is crazy to see how cheap some of these stocks got.

I'm aiming for 10x on each pick, obviously there is a high likelihood none of these 10x but, to justify investment with a high risk tolerance and long time horizon it makes little sense for me to buy an AAPL or MSFT-mature growth

Looking back on it, I wish I had bought SQ, ROKU, TSLA, SHOP before they blew up these past couple of years into what they are today,. What, in your eyes are those stocks and why? Sure they could still be SQ ROKU and SHOP and I will continue to add these on red days.

My research has led me to consider the following:

**IPOE** (Sofi), I really like Square and may add it but its market cap is already 100 billion. I haven't done nearly enough DD and would love to hear other's take on it. Little scared the lending side of the company comprises too much of the business but it could give the co a nice backbone to pair with their brand's higher growth components: Galileo acquisition and trading platform

**ROKU:** Love the company, obviously tough competition but seems they are outpacing amazon and changing the way our streaming services are monetized- not sure if we'll ever see 400 billion here but I also really like **MGNI** and the pullback its given us.

**SPTK**: to me, this gives off plug energy vibes. It has a relatively small market cap, approx. 5 billion depending on the day and is a market leader in AI, clean energy. Massive TAM. I could go more in depth but I think its well positioned to grow in coming years.

Next up is **Unity(U) and C3 AI(AI)**: I am grouping these together because both are still extremely expensive based on valuation and are recent IPOs but have lots of long term growth ahead in both their respectable spaces, AR/VR and AI

**TDOC:** Huge fan of Cathie Woods but I struggle to develop conviction in this oen and would love to hear what you guys think of it- was a fan of livongo but it seems like that area of the high flying business has been

**PINS:** lotta potential here, theres a reason MSFT has tried to acquire these guys

**UPWK/FVRR**: As society becomes increasingly postmodern, the gig economy will only continue to expand, pricy now and set for correction as we transition out of covid but am long.

**ARKK, ARKF (any one of the ARK funds really)**: set and forget. Harder to get the exponential gains when portfolio allocation is capped at 10% maximum but still offer great exposure to tech with little worry knowing Cathie is running the show

**ETSY:** niche that not even Amazon can compete w, like the company alot esp after how they crushed earnings. Undeniably a benefactor of covid and could see more pull back

This dip recently has made me suffer... I went from being up 40% to in the red overall.

SO... is the bond yield news and the shift to small cap and retail the only reason this is happening? My plan is to just buy the dip in what in already invested in and let the dip run its course and wait long term to see my gains... do you all agree with this?",2021-03-08
m2vxyl,27,28,stocks,Taking Another Look at ROKU,0.84,1615513202.0,1615484402.0,"Hi guys today I'd like to direct your attention to Roku Inc. This stock is famously one of Cathie Woods top holdings, representing 5.97% of ARKK and 3.9% of ARKW, the third and fifth largest holdings respectively. Recently it has taken a beating and has dipped from its high of $487 down to its current price of $353. It had a historical high of $53B market cap that has now dropped down to $45B. Many people rightly regard many of ARK funds holdings cautiously with good reason- they're highly overvalued and present a lot of risk to investors who fear they may be buying at the top. With the recent downturn in prices, I think it's a good time to see if ROKU is still overvalued.


**The Business**

For those who are unfamiliar Roku is a brand of hardware media player that integrates content apps such as Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ etc into one platform. Roku delivers its hardware in two forms: streaming devices and licensing its operating system to smart TV manufacturers. 

Streaming devices

Roku has 5 streaming devices that are available to date. Streaming devices can be attached to the side of your television to deliver the Roku platform. Competitors include Google Chromecast, Amazing Fire stick, Nvidia Shield, Apple TV

ROKU Express - 40$. Your standard Roku box that can be hooked up to your TV with an HDMI cable
ROKU Premiere - $45 Just the ROKU Express but with HD
ROKU Streaming Stick - $70. This is a wireless version of the ROKU Premiere. 
ROKU Ultra - $100. This is the most high quality, premium product line and basically the Premiere but even better with 4K . 
ROKU Streambar - $130 Roku Ultra but with a sound system included. 

ROKU TVs

Roku licenses its software platform to television manufacturers so they can integrate them into their smart TVs. TV manufacturers get a cheap deal that allows them to create a better product without having to hire a team of developers to create their own platform from the ground up, and ROKU can gain more product adoption and users as fast as possible. 

Currently it is no exaggeration to say that ROKU is dominating the smart TV field. It is the number one smart TV platform and is integrated into approximately 40% of smart TVs sold in the USA and 31% in Canada. Roku has long term deals with all of the major TV manufacturers: Sharp, Hisense, Sky, Sanyo, TCL, etc. Their competitors in this space include Samsung who developed their own OS Tizon, LGs webOS, and the Android OS. 

In the long term, there is no doubt that consumers are shifting away from cable TV and towards streaming and Roku is a streaming company well poised to take market control here. Many older audiences who consume media are confused by how streaming works and aren't the best at navigating a Google Chromecast or Apple TV cast device. Roku is one the most intuitive product that allows this demographic to seamlessly transition into the internet streaming age. I believe this is one of their biggest differentiators as their UI/UX is extremely easy and efficient to use, and just in my anecdotal experience there's always some technical problem with other products that I never run into with ROKU. 

As of EOY 2020 Roku had 51 million active users- compare that with other streaming companies such as Netflix (204M), Amazon (150M), Disney+(87M), Hulu (39M). Their cheap ROKU streaming products and ROKU smart TV's are highly accessible and easy to set up making customer acquisition rates grow at 40%+ YOY. Their strategy is generally selling cheap products upfront to get these customers onboard, then monetize them after. This will continue as ROKU expands further into Mexico and Brazil this year. 


**Revenue Streams**

Roku has two revenue streams: Player and Platform revenue. 

Player revenue is the proceeds Roku receives from selling its Roku devices. This is the lower margin and lower revenue generating revenue stream. 

2020 Player revenue: 510M, up 30% YOY. 

Platform revenue is the proceeds Roku receives from advertising, licensing, and subscriptions. This makes up the bulk of Rokus revenue streams and has very low cost of revenue. It's effectively how well Roku can monetize its user base- and Roku has done impressively well in this regard. 

Key Metric: Average revenue per user 
2020 ARPU 28.76 (24%)
2019 ARPU 23.14 (29%)
2018 ARPU 17.95 (30%)
2017 ARPU 13.78 (76%)
2016 ARPU 7.83 

While Netflix averaged $13.32 revenue per user in 2020 Roku has averaged $28.76 per user. Roku is able to accomplishes their great ARPU mainly through their best in class advertising options. Roku has an impressive mix of advertising options that maintain a non-invasive experience for the customer while providing tons of value for the marketer. Roku's advertising options include:

For advertisers and marketers

* OneView Ad management: This is Roku's native, built in, integrated platform for demand side marketers. Roku feels that there is an increasing desire for self-serve flexibility from marketers, and OneView is the perfect product for that. OneView is a self-serve option for marketers who would like to purchase ads on Roku and integrates all of Roku's data available for marketers to use at their disposal. Previously Roku acquired Dataxu DSP and integrated it into OneView, allowing OneView to be even more efficient at obtaining and filtering the data marketers want. 

* Brand Experiences: Basically this allows companies to purchase space on Roku's home screen to push their product. Example would be below where Microsoft not only advertised their Surface laptop but also offered a free movie rental. 

https://imgur.com/a/mrRoWs1

For content creators and publishers:

* Homescreen Ads: allows purchases of space on the home screen directly to push shows. 

* Screensaver ads: Roku has a screensaver that turns on when you leave your device untouched for too long. Companies can purchase screensaver space to advertise

* Video ads when users watch the free Roku channel (can purchase either 15 seconds or 30 seconds)

* Primetime Ads: Allows companies to purchase slots on Roku home page for their shows at peak streaming hours. 

Here is an example of Disney pushing their new movie ""Soul"" by purchasing ad space

https://imgur.com/gallery/EZAjBCo

In March 2021 Roku also announced it is expanding its partnership with Nielsen, as Roku will acquire Nielsens Advanced video advertising (AVA) business. This includes video automatic content recognition, ad content measurement tech, and dynamic ad insertion tech. This will be huge for ROKU as it will now be able to integrate the Nielsen ""always on"" digital ad ratings into its OneView platform for marketers. 

It is important to note here that Roku will only show advertisements to users if they are watching from the Roku channel. If users are watching Netflix or any of the other third party app such as Hulu they will not view advertisements. Again, Roku stresses a non-invasive advertising strategy for its users. 

**Financials and Valuation**

*Income Statement*

Roku is posting another unprofitable year while they attempt to expand as much as possible, although 2020 was very nearly a break-even year with net 17M in losses. Q3 and Q4 for Roku this year were profitable, and I personally expect ROKU to be break profit overall for 2021. Roku's weakest quarters historically are the first two of the year with sales and profit picking up in Q3 and Q4, and Roku guidance points towards that trend continuing for the 2021 year. 

Roku offered guidance for the Q1 2021 with 51% YOY increase to $485M and EBITDA of $31M. Overall, Q1 is expected to be unprofitable as usual for Roku, as it is their weakest quarter historically. There is an estimated $40M in stock based compensation in Q1 as well as $10M in depreciation, and management has estimated net income at roughly $(20M). This is still a large improvement YOY from the $(55M) from Q1 2020. 


*Balance Sheet*

Current Ratio sits at 2.5 so Roku is safely able to continue operating without a problem for the near future. 

Their largest liability is ""accrued liabilities"" which increased 75% YOY. This is largely due to the fact that Roku has been acquiring rights to stream content for free on their ROKU channel and has doubled their payments due to content publishers. Their marketing accrued liabilities increase 6 fold as they attempt to expand even further, and the lease payments for a new office doubled as they expanded their facilities. Aside from this their debt remains in line with the 2019 year with no other notable debts. 

*Cash Flow*

Roku has 1.1B in cash however was only able to increase net cash by 140M through operating activities- vast majority of its cash is raised via financing another round in May 2020. There is continued risk of share dilution here. 

*DCF*

Very basic construction of DCF here, forecasted out 5 years with a WACC of 10 and perpetuity growth rate of 3%. Revenues growing at 45% down to 38%. Net profit margin projected to be 5% in 2021 up to 15% in 2025. Ultimately yielded approximately $105B in total value, $722 per share (assuming no more share dilution). Again, it was a just a back of the napkin DCF so there was no sensitivity tables or even de-levering FCF etc. 

I believe that this is in line with ROKU's potential to become a 90 billion market cap company. 

*Multiples Valuation*

EV/Revenue multiple

Roku EV = 44,642,527,000
EV/Revenue = 25.12

The deal with Roku is that its competitors are large players- Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Apple, and Netflix. Of these, we can only reliably compare Roku multiples with Netflix as its too difficult to reliably separate the streaming segments out of the other companies financials. 

Netflix EV= 304B
Netflix EV/Revenue= 12.16

As you can see, despite Netflix carrying loads of debt Netflix still has the more reasonable valuation. There is continued risk here that ROKU is overvalued. 


**The Bull case**

Roku continues its growth as outlined in my DCF of 45% down to 30% in the next 7 years. I believe this is entirely possible as Rokus platform revenue is growing at a 70% rate and should only increase as their ARPU increases. 

Roku has an insane ARPU compared to other companies. While Netflix may have 4 times the users, it has far slower growth in ARPU as the business model doesn't allow for much monetization. Reed Hastings in January 2021 reiterated that Netflix will not monetize its users any further by offering advertising options because it would be too difficult to compete with the big players in advertisement (Google/Amazon/Facebook). 

Roku has proven Netflix wrong in this area for certain. The bull case is Roku continues to grow its ARPU- giving extremely conservative estimates of growing at 12% per year ARPU could level off in 3 years at $40. 

As Roku expands its user base further globally the ARPU could potentially even have years where it contracts after that. However, I won't say that I can confidently give any bull case regarding international expansion as no guidance was offered in the reports or conference calls. 

ROKU has also been acquiring more and more content rights to add to the ROKU Channel. Roku recently acquired rights to Quibi and stated in the conference call that they will continue the trend in the future. 

**Bear Case**

At this point insolvency in the foreseeable future is too unlikely to be considered for Roku. However, there absolutely is a future where growth may slow down after COVID as peoples lives return to normalcy more. COVID provided many growth opportunities for Roku with people staying at home all day, and as that tapers off there is a chance growth will as well. 

Roku is still overvalued at a 25x revenue multiple. It's not as expensive as PLTR or SNOW, but just purely by revenue multiples it's more overvalued than Tesla at any point in 2020. 

**Conclusion**

You can draw your own conclusion from the information I've laid out, but I believe Roku is a great pickup right now. 

Roku's greatest strength is its focus on monetizing its users and the plethora of advertising options available for advertisers. It's $28 ARPU beats out Facebook, Netflix, Pinterest, and many other companies by far. Granted it does not have the international reach of those companies which should bring the ARPU down, but even comparing their US audience ARPU Roku blows surpasses many other advertisement based businesses. 

It's recent partnership with Nielsen is fantastic for advertisers and should give them more tools at their disposal. I believe that the market that Roku operates in will only grow, as cable cutting continues, and that out of all its competitors Roku has the best offerings for advertisers.",2021-03-11

These days I look at the recent IPO filings on Nasdaq.com and all I see is a sea of SPAC haha.


I made a list in December of 2020 and with Roblox crossed off after their recent IPO I thought I'd share the next 4 in line and see if anybody wanted to share theirs as well. In addition to the unicorns, there are a ton of companies with potential out there that most people aren't too familiar with, so if you think you've got a 3, 5, or even 10 bagger then drop your names below!


Mine are as follows:


1.Applovin

1.45B revenue in 2020. Basically a company that helps app developers promote their app, acquire users, and monetize their app. Growing at a fast pace and has achieved profitability every year except for 2020 due to aggressive content acquisition and expansion. 


2.Vizio

2B revenue in 2020. This company is a household name and doesn't have the flashy revenue growth as other tech companies that are recently IPO-ing. But the idea that this company is going for is that they hope to model themselves after ROKU. They have a very high quality SmartTV OS and TV manufacturing line that is already vertically integrated, and they hope to expand by monetizing their Vizio SmartTV OS the same way Roku does- basically by SVOD, advertising, and selling user data. We'll see if it can catch ROKU in this market segment. 


3.Nextdoor

Just going out on a limb but I think COVID helped people who normally ignore their neighbors get to know them a bit better. Especially if you live in a condo/apartment or whatever. Nextdoor is a nifty app that lets people connect with their physical neighbors and communities, and I think COVID was just the right catalyst for them to take off. There's not much on this company that I could find regarding their financials unfortunately, but apparently at their last funding round in late 2019 they were valued at 2B, and apparently are looking for a valuation of maybe 5B in 2021. 

I am bullish though as Sarah Friar is heading Nextdoor. CFO of Square, Senior VP at Salesforce, and served on the Board of Directors of Walmart and Slack. Banking background. Very confident in her abilities to drive the vision of the company forward. 

4.This one was tough, but I think Olo is a great high upside pick. Olo builds the software and platform that connects restaurants to users. Notable brands that use them include the Cheesecake Factory, Shake Shack, Wingstop, and Dennys. They can help build apps, order tracking software, and delivery coordination platforms for restaurants. 


There are some more high profile ones like Databricks, UIPath, Coinbase, Robinhood, and Instacart that aren't listed above but I wanted to share some lesser known ones that I'm personally bullish on and probably won't get as much attention.",2021-03-12

Really not many stocks looking good as of right now in the pre market, but there are a few and as day traders we can almost always find something to trade. If it doesn't show up pre market then we have our main watch lists that are filled with movers and shakers and we also have scans to run after the open that will help us find new runners. My plan as of right now will to be patient and only trade the best charts with room to move on the daily chart. I will not trade a stock without a good daily chart. If I don't see anything I like after the open, then I may choose not to trade and call it a week. Good luck out there, have a good weekend, see you all Monday.

m6n7uy,16,26,stocks,ARK Trading Strategies,0.95,1615968391.0,1615939591.0,"As a subscriber to ARK's daily trade updates, I've been curious to watch how she trades around the volatility over the past few months.  Cathie has stated on several occasions that she uses large cap stocks as ""cash-like instruments"" and rotates into them when her conviction plays get frothy (thus expanding her total population of stocks).  When the market drops, she consolidates and concentrates the portfolio back into her high-conviction names.  I've also noticed some other interesting trades that she has made recently that piqued my interest:

**ROKU:**  ARKW bought ROKU on 3/8 (daily range $325-356), then turned around and sold ROKU from the same fund on 3/15 (daily range $354-363).  If bought at the absolute low and sold at the absolute high on those days, that would be a 12% gain.  Great return over 1 week, but if she had enough conviction to buy at $325, why sell so quickly?  

**HIMS:**  ARKG bought HIMS on 1/27 (daily range $13.00-14.40), then sold on 2/23 (daily range $14.90-17.63) when the market began to panic.  This is particularly interesting because the fund was initiating a new position in a company.  I would expect if they bought into a new company that there was some underlying thesis that should have remained intact even after a 10-20% upward move.  Interestingly, she has continued to sell out of this ticker completely.  

These are two very different examples.  

ROKU, like Tesla, is a staple of the portfolio and another strategy she uses is trading around these types of names (ARK has made lots of money trading Tesla).  Since this is a mature investment in the portfolio, she seems to have a designated percent of the portfolio she wants to allocated to it.  When the market drops 10%, she buys more to keep that percentage intact.  When it recovers, she sells off what she bought again maintaining the base percentage.  And on and on, making nice trading profits on high-conviction plays that she wants to keep at a set percentage in the fund.  She can always change that set percentage if she has more conviction in the company by letting it appreciate without selling or simply buying more.  I think this is a valuable strategy to use for high-conviction investments that you have built to a comfortable percentage of your portfolio.  

HIMS on the other hand is a small and new add to the portfolio.  I find it interesting and odd to see her buy into something completely new and then lose conviction within weeks.  Around the same time she bought HIMS, she also bought BFLY.  While she sold out of HIMS during the downturn, she gobbled up more BFLY during the same period.  This is what I would expect a fund would do when a new investment they just made goes on sale.  But while she bought more BFLY, she sold out of HIMS.  I'm curious if others have found ARK trading around small/new positions frequently (i.e. entering and exiting them completely) or if these types of transactions should be viewed as a more significant change in sentiment toward the underlying company.  

Disclosure: I own shares of ARKK, ROKU, HIMS, BFLY  (hence why I follow all of them).",2021-03-16

Does anyone else just want to puke when they see their commercial on CNBC for Follow the Smart Money?

If you haven't seen it, here's their strategy in a nutshell: 

Imagine you're in middle school, and there's a quiz in Zoology class today. Zoology is taught at different periods throughout the day, every kid in the grade will take the quiz at some point throughout the day. Everyone's known about the quiz for weeks, and most kids have studied and are prepared. Not Pete and Jon, they haven't studied shit. They have a different strategy to pass the quiz. 

Luckily for them, Pete and Jon have Zoology during 6th period, late in the day after many kids have already taken the quiz. So, Pete and Jon ask as many people at Recess as they can, what their answers were. They have no idea who the smart kids are, but there is a really loud kid who is POSITIVE he got the right answer. Pete and Jon don't know if this kid is smart or dumb, but they do know he's very convicted about being right. So, they decide to listen to this loud kid and use his answers when they take the test.

That's their strategy: copy the loud kid. Not sit next to the smartest kid in class and cheat off his/her paper, just listen to the loud kid at recess and use his answers. Follow the Loud Kid.

In their real world applications of this strategy, they monitor options chains and wait to see a volume spike in a particular order. They have no idea who is making the trade, it could be the smartest trader in the world, a hedge fund covering a position or some drunken billionaire letting his pet monkey pick his next stock trade. They see that high volume trade and then they copy it. That's it. ""Oh look, Jon, someone just bought 1000 ROKU June 350 Calls. That's a lot, let's buy those too. Good thinking, Pete."" The end, that's what they do.

*****

> # 1. Stock futures fall after Dow record as yields jump

> * U.S. stock futures dropped Tuesday as the 10-year Treasury yield hit a new 14-month high in early trading. The Nasdaq dropped Monday. The S&P 500 on Monday fell from the previous session’s record close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average bucked Monday’s downdraft, closing at another record despite weakness in bank stocks caught in the fallout of the Archegos Capital Management margin call chaos. With two days left in March, the Dow and S&P 500 were sitting on solid gains for the month. The Nasdaq was tracking for a monthly loss.

*****

> # 2. 10-year Treasury yield hits new 14-month high

> * The 10-year Treasury yield topped 1.77% early Tuesday, taking out another January 2020 high, as Covid vaccine rollouts and planned infrastructure spending boosted hopes of a broad U.S. economic recovery. However, the move also stoked inflation fears and put growth stocks, many of them tech names, under pressure because higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations.

*****

> # 3. How Goldman and Morgan Stanley avoided Archegos losses

> * In the Archegos meltdown, triggered by last week’s slide in shares of ViacomCBS and other stocks, Goldman Sachs avoided losses in the episode, CNBC’s Hugh Son reported. By the time Switzerland’s Credit Suisse and Japan’s Nomura said early Monday they unloaded positions on behalf of Archegos, Goldman Sachs and its Wall Street rival Morgan Stanley had already finished unloading their positions, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Archegos is a family office founded and by Bill Hwang, a former equity analyst at Julian Robertson’s Tiger Management.

*****

> # 4. CDC chief warns U.S. headed for ‘impending doom’ in Covid fight

> * The U.S. is facing “impending doom” as daily U.S. Covid cases begin to rebound once again, warned CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. “We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope, but right now I’m scared,” she said in an emotional, candid moment during Monday morning’s press briefing. Even as vaccinations accelerate nationwide, coronavirus hospitalizations are also climbing and falling fatalities are starting to plateau. Walensky urged Americans to “just hold on a little longer.”

*****

> # 5. Biden tells states to reinstate coronavirus mask mandates

> * President Joe Biden followed his CDC director’s comments by urging governors and local leaders who dropped sweeping mask mandates to reinstate their orders. While indicating that some states should wait to reopen their economies, he also condemned “reckless behavior” likely to spur more infections. “We’re giving up hard-fought, hard-won gains,” Biden said in Monday afternoon’s press briefing. “As much as we’re doing America, it’s time to do even more.” He said a failure to take the virus seriously “is precisely what got us in this mess in the first place” and could lead to more infections and deaths.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

mh8q4p,59,134,wallstreetbets,VZIO: The IPO That Flew Under the Radar,0.88,1617233703.0,1617204903.0," 

Hello fellow degenerates.

VZIO  IPO'd last Friday and it appears to have flown largely under the radar  which I'd attribute to all the other crazy shit happening last week. I  didn't even know about it until shares were already for sell. The shares  went on sale in the 17-18 dollar range, way under the proposed 21-23  range. Seeing this looked at the numbers and bought some shares because I  thought they were impressive.

I'm  just gonna throw it out there that I am not a financial expert and this  is my first time reading numbers from a prospectus document so if you  see any logical errors or bad numbers please point them out. I'll  largely be using the numbers I got from the prospectus document found  here: [https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-082123/](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-082123/)

As  of last Friday VZIO has put 15.2 million shares for sale on the market.  The company's total shares outstanding as of 2020 was \~144million  (these aren't on sale, just held by inside investors). At the current  stock price of 24.5 that puts the company's market cap at about 3.5  billion. According to RH VZIO's current P/E is about 4.45, which is  insanely low for a well known brand and a growth stock, which leads me  to believe the stock is majorly undervalued. The stock price could  easily quadruple to put the P/E around 20 which is more inline with  competitors.

The last couple of  years VZIO has transitioned from being just a hardware company selling  TVs to also becoming a streaming server provider. Because of the low  margins on this service it has become a huge income stream for them and a  source of extraordinary growth. Think of their streaming service like  Roku, but actually built into the TV. VZIO's income and revenue for the  past couple years were:

Total net revenue

2019 $1,836,799,000

2020 $2,042,473,000

Total gross profit

2019 $165,165,000

2020 $296,358,000

Net income

2019 $23,086,000

2020 $102,475,000

The  net income increase was largely due to the profits from their Platform+  revenue which has grown 304% from $36.4million in 2018 to $147 million  in 2020. The CEO states that the company plans to reinvest that money  into the hardware side of the business to develop better TVs. Another  bonus is that the CEO has deep ties to Asia manufacturing which has  proven to be extremely helpful in them securing required components for  their TVs and keeping their supply lines healthy while competitors face  shortages.

Taken form the  prospective document as of December 31, 2020, Vizio had $207.7 million  in cash and $625.8 million in total liabilities.

Vizio's recent financial results can be summed up as follows:

* Increasing operating profit and margin (They are making more money and making more money with less cost)
* Growing topline revenue
* Sharply increased gross profit and gross margin
* Growing earnings
* Reduced cash flow from operations

The  HD TV market is growing and expected to grow substantially in the next  few years. As of 2020 Vizio also made up the third largest brand of HD  tvs in American homes, so it has massive name recognition.  VZIO has a  lot of big rivals to compete against in this growing market that may try  to take out the smaller competitors. The name recognition might help  VZIO's potential for acquisition by a large player seeking to quickly  enter the Smart TV/connected home market by buying out an established  brand. In the past VZIO has shown it is willing to sale. It was supposed  to be purchased by a Chinese company a few years ago, but the deal fell  through.

In the short-term all  the stimulus will likely keep demand for TVs purchase high, which makes  short term prospects for VZIO look pretty good. The long-term potential  for growing their operating margins through streaming services, a ever  growing TV market, and the potential for buyout makes them a solid place  to park some money.

TLDR;

The  company is profitable, growing in the streaming segment, increasing  earning, and has all the right ingredients to become a big player in the  next generation of connected TVs by offering a TV + streaming service  similar to ROKU but in one piece of hardware. Also, there's only 15  million shares on the open market so a lot of demand can cause a big  increase in the stock price in the short term.

[Senate Stock trading vs. S&P 500](https://preview.redd.it/4tqxbg3gxkr61.png?width=1960&format=png&auto=webp&s=da597db3d306e5abf848080cec1726e6bce09730)

A while back I did a little write-up on which politicians I actually think browse this sub, I’ll copy that below:

**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**

Comstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.

She bought \~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.

**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***

Lowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.

If I had to guess, I'd say Lowenthal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.

**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***

The Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A lesser man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.

**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**

***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***

Pat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.

Insider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.

WSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.

**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**

***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***

Marshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.

What Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.

**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**

***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***

The story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.

On July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.

Although he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.

Sadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.

After holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up.",2021-04-06

===========TRADING DAY, WEDNESDAY APRIL 7=====================

TSLA GANG, today was choppy af. TSLA went for the gap fill almost to 661, but held up at 666-669 (which may be possible support for a gap up tomorrow IF no market BS comes up). Looking for a gap up to 690+ run up to touch 700. If TSLA bulls are strong along with the rest of the market, we can fight for the 700 line and end the week 720+. That's my take but then again I'm -40% deep in more retarded calls so hopefully law of attraction works and papa musk hears my prayers.

Locked in gains with ROKU calls and puts early on. Steep drop followed by a quick V recovery because I was playing both ROKU and TSLA calls and puts.

Went in quick AMZN $2900 puts 4/16, in hindsight should've held it to anticipate sell off/breakdown towards EOD. I was too fixated on TSLA and ROKU.

Like a retard, I kept adding on to my TSLA 700c 4/9 position and screenshoted this at  2:10 PM EST but failed to exit. Guess what happened after?

Market sold off + TSLA trying to fill that gap to 661. Ended up holding these bad boys ayyy. That's what happened when you don't follow the golden rule;

IF ITS GOOD ENOUGH TO SCREENSHOT, ITS GOOD ENOUGH TO SELL. Had unloaded and took that -5% loss up there\^, I wouldn't 1. hold this massive fucking bag, and 2. rebuy the 4/16 calls to give me some time even if I believe in the bounce back up / gap up. Hell I could've yolo'd 230k worth with a cost of $3.

My numbers plugged into Options Profit Calculator: [http://opcalc.com/sYl](http://opcalc.com/sYl)I suggest everyone learn how to use this so you can gauge the next day. Plug in your calls/and IV to get the most accurate numbers.

Point your finger at April 8 column and go down to 690. If TSLA is at $690, my position is up 6.84% and so on. If TSLA would've done a end of day rally to say 685-690 or past the high of day to 695, then my position would be 50-98% up.. But it didn't so now I'm bagholding

End of day, I dumped everything into TSLA $700c 4/16.

mmzkjx,105,324,wallstreetbets,"Fubo Tv-DD: A potential Short Squeeze, but also a low risk/high reward investment.",0.86,1617939225.0,1617910425.0," 

Alright, listen up y’all. I’ve been working on some FUBO DD, and I will be presenting you a bull case, but not without presenting some counter arguments.

Pros: 

1. **Sports Betting**: As many of you may know, FUBO plans to add integrated sports gambling tied into their streams as an option. The sports gambling market is expected to roughly quadruple in the next 4 years overall. FUBO only needs to get a small slice of that pie. 
2. **Value compared it to its competitors**: FUBO has a market cap of about 2.9B. ROKU=48B. DFKN=24.5B. I think we all understand Roku and Draft Kings are much better at what they do then fubo, but 10x-20x more valuation? That’s a stretch. Simply based of FUBOs revenue and market cap, this stock should be tripled. 
3. **Aggressiveness as a company**; With the acquisition of Vigtory, and a recent closing of a deal with Marquee Network I like how they are not satisfied as a company and they are swinging for the fences. 
4. **Options spreads**: i don’t know if its big brained gamblers or insiders who know whats coming, but the recent Volume on Calls compared to Puts is ridiculous. A put/call ratio from 0.07-0.19 for the rest of April, and an implied volatility of 130%.
5. **Future Growth, Cord cutting**: Cord cutting has only just started. More and more will move to streaming platforms, and FUBO has been winning more than its fair share of those customers. Their expected revenue for 2021 is 460M which is incredible based on their market cap. They have 550k subscribers,73% growth year over year. Also their advertising deals are growing too, 53% growth year over year. receiving $20 per user for ads. 
6. **Institutional Holders:** Tutes own roughly 40% of the shares, Disney being one of the big share owners.
7. **Natural Cycle of a Growth Stock:** If anyone thinks this is a POS stock because it's gone down a bunch for no reason? Guess what, pretty much any young company has that experience before the rockets take off. Look at ROKU for example. From Nov19-March 20, it lost more than 50% of its value over that time period.Then it jumped up 600%
8. **Short Squeeze**: FUBO has some serious potential for a short squeeze, the short float is at 35%, and it's already been beaten down enough. We’ve seen plenty of examples of the shorts picking on a “cult” stock that is already down plenty from recent high, with relatively low float.

Reasons for the stock collapse:

It has been a perfect storm for Fubo bears. The stock has been  in a free fall since February.

1. A pullback from its parabolic rise in 3 months was inevitable.
2. The Q4 2020, ER report confirmed the company's growth. But because they are not making money, which of course they're not, there was a selloff nonetheless.
3. Money was shifted out of growth stocks to more profitable stocks recently.
4. There are some fugaze lawsuits coming FUBOs way, but any stock that has fallen this much is under lawsuit, this is nothing to worry about.
5. Arcehgo’s hedge Fund defaulted $30 billion, much of that was in media companies (most notably DISCA, VIAC, and to a lesser extent FUBO). 
6. FUBO’s IPO investor Lock-Up ended April 6th, and the sell off on the 7th.
7. The shorties, its always the fucking shorts

Cons:

1. Technical Analysis, which is wizardry to a mere mortal like me suggests that worst case scenario, FUBO goes down to $15. But I can’t imagine we will get there, I think it holds up at support. It has bounced off the 200ma 4 times in the last couple weeks.
2. I can only assume they are bleeding cash, and may need to have an offering soon
3. Their business model , vMVPD, seems like a very boomerish way of “cord cutting”. Because you’re still paying for a bunch of shit you may not want. 
4. Will the gambling aspect work? People like DFKG and fan duel just fine. 
5. There are probably some serious bag holders in the $30-40 range, and we could see some resistance from them as they look to sell when they break even. 

TLDR:

I think this is an amazing swing play for a squeeze, a good long term investment if the squeeze doesn’t come. FUBO is 1 PR away from triggering a beautiful run up, then the FOMO sets in, and boom, they are back at $30 before you know it. And if you degenerates start chipping in, we’re at $50+ in a heartbeat.There are some obvious negatives about the company & the stock, but if there wasn’t , this puppy would be at $150 by now. This is a low-risk, high reward play that we are lucky to even have the opportunity to be a part of.

ms5tbv,12,34,stocks,MGNI reporting Q1 earnings May 10,0.97,1618616444.0,1618587644.0,"MGNI was a stock I got into into right before Thanksgiving after doing some research on good growth stocks for the first half of 2021. They are a sell-side advertising provider.

Supply/Sell Side Platforms connect advertisers to publishers to ensure advertising inventory is properly filled within the publishers available channels. This is normally used by publishers to gain access to advertisers. This is where MGNI operates.

This compares to Demand Side Platforms that are  is used by advertisers to find publishers.

The goal of these platforms is to ensure that advertising inventory is properly targeted towards the consumers who are viewing publisher channels.

An example of sell side would be an in-house advertising company like Apple who would use MGNI to find proper publishers to target their iPhone ads. An example of demand side would be Roku using TTD to fill commercials between free streamed videos. Before advertising platforms, advertisers and publishers would do direct sales, but this lead to inefficiencies in targeted audiences and scalability.

As stated, MGNI operates on the sell side. They primarily target advertisers and work to find the proper publishers for which the advertiser's ads will find a home. As on their website, one of their clients is Discovery Communications which uses MGNI to properly target ads for their product portfolio.

MGNI makes money by offering proper placement of ads and also tracking of their efficiency. From their 10k filing:
> We provide a full suite of tools for sellers to control their advertising business and protect the consumer viewing experience. These controls are particularly important to CTV sellers who need to ensure a TV-like viewing and advertising experience for consumers.
> Buyers leverage our platform to manage their advertising spending and reach their target audiences on brand-safe premium inventory, simplify order management and campaign tracking, obtain actionable insights into audiences for their advertising, and access impression-level purchasing from thousands of sellers. We believe that our scale, platform features, and omni-channel offering makes us an essential partner for buyers.

MGNI has seen a 150% gain in stock price since November based on positive momentum in their connected TV offering. 2020 was the first year they saw solid CTV growth and its a new revenue stream for them. This has allowed their revenue to increase by almost 50% between 2019 and 2020. CTV makes up 15% of all their revenue, Desktop makes 36% and Mobile makes 49%. All three segments are growing, with CTV being the top growth line. Their revenue in 2020 was $221M.

I believe the stock has rallied based on expected CTV revenue growth in the future. At a stock price of $40, MGNI has a market cap of $4.5Bn. This puts its P/S ratio at about 20. Not too egregious but definitely high. If they can maintain 50% revenue growth YoY, that P/S ratio falls to a much more paltry 13.

Their margins are  currently 66%, which is consistent YoY. The main reason they didn't post a profit in 2020 was due to increased sales/marketing cost, higher administrative cost and what seems to be a one time restructuring cost.

In their Q1 earnings, here's what you should be looking for:

- How close is the stock to $40? $40 seems to be a good place for MGNI leading into May 10. If its above $40, I would trim my position to manage risk. If its below $40, I would increase my position based on risk tolerance. I pick $40 because that sets a P/S ratio of 20, and is the midpoint and support level since the February annual report.

- With the shutdown of 3rd party cookie tracking by browser and endpoints, sell-side advertising tracking has become more critical to have effectively targeted ads. Magnite has been putting out good PR trying to focus on this macro trend.

- Growth of the CTV business. We should see CTV moving towards almost 30% of total revenue.


If we don't see revenues of approximately $80M, with CTV business making up $20M of that revenue, I think that MGNI will see a sell off.


Right now, MGNI is seeing overall downward pressure that's affecting all small/mid cap companies. Its hard to remain convicted when its eating 3% losses every day. If MGNI doesn't find support at $35, its falling all the way to $18 where it found support after the December short attack by Spruce Point Capital.

If earnings show another 50% QoQ or YoY growth rate in revenue, buoyed by strong CTV and 3rd party cookie demand, I could imagine MGNI going to $50 to maintain a P/S ratio of 20. Anything short of that, I see MGNI falling to $20 until next earnings.",2021-04-16

FuboTV is a live TV streaming company focused primarily on sports which offers subscribers access to thousands of live sporting events, news, and entertainment content. The FuboTV platform allows users to have access to their content through streaming devices such as SmartTV's, mobile phones, computers, and tablets. This company gives the option to purchase additional features/packages that include more DVR cloud storage, number of simultaneous streams, international sports, adventure channels, etc. The base package provides a mixture of channels which includes the top 50 Nielson-ranked networks that span across sports, news, and entertainment. In the summer of 2020, they enhanced their sports offerings with the addition of ESPN and ABC as well as programming from Disney. In addition, FuboTV supports 4K streaming, although much of its content is streamed at 720p and 60 frames-per-second video quality. Since live TV requires a sophisticated technology infrastructure, Fubo utilizes industry standard digital Rights Management Technology and geographical rights requirements which enables them to meet blackouts if they were to occur. With all that content, FuboTV is one of the most expensive live tv packages that you can buy. Their competitors include the likes of YouTube TV ($64.99), Sling TV ($35.00), Hulu Live TV ($65), and more. Fubo's growth strategy is focused on acquiring new subscribers who are attracted to the sports and entertainment offerings that they provide. They monetize their subscriber base through subscription fees and digital advertising and in 2020 the majority of their revenue came from monthly subscriptions. Furthermore, in January of 2021 Fubo announced that they plan on acquiring sports betting and interactive gaming company Vigtory (see recent acquisition section) and they expect to launch a sportsbook before the end of the year.

# Total Addressable Market (TAM)

Live TV streaming is changing the way people watch their favorite sports, shows, and other entertainment content. As a result, more people are deciding to stop paying for traditional TV. Due to this disruption, billions of dollars in subscription and advertising revenue has shifted to streaming platforms. The global video streaming market size was valued at $50.11 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of roughly 21% from 2021 to 2028. In addition to the streaming market which Fubo currently operates in, their commitment to providing sports betting has expanded their total addressable market. The global sports betting industry reached a market size of $203 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow by $144.4 billion from 2020-2024 (11% CAGR). What hinders the growth of this industry is the fact that sports betting is still illegal in many parts of the world. Sports betting is currently legal in a number of states in the US and in countries such as the UK, Denmark, Italy, China, and a few others. While sports betting is legal in a number of countries, often times people have limited access. For example, in Costa Rica you can only bet online and in India only a few states allow sports betting.

If we add together the total addressable markets for live TV streaming and sports betting in the year of 2020 we get $253.11 billion. Compare that number to Fubo's revenue of $268.8 million in 2020 and we see that Fubo has a huge opportunity ahead of itself. As Fubo scales their new sports betting business and more countries and states make sports betting legal, we should see Fubo ramping up revenue growth significantly. Of course their is a risk to all this as it is very costly to scale both businesses that Fubo operates. Thus, their financial results will give us an idea of how they've been growing and if they can maintain the level of growth they've seen in the past.

# Important Points to Address

* Revenue was up 83% YoY as advertising revenue grew to $29 million (up 133% YoY) and subscription revenue increased 73% to $230.7 million. As we can see from the numbers, this company is growing at a fast clip. Although the revenue growth they reported is impressive, when looking at their balance sheet they still reported an operating loss of roughly $480 million which was a drastic increase from the prior year which came in at $39 million. Additionally, as this business has scaled they saw their operating expenses jump from $43 million in 2019 to $698 million in 2020 and their goodwill reach $478 million. What these numbers show me is that while this company is growing fast, much of that growth isn't necessarily organic. They spent $63 million on advertising in 2020, while only spending $491,000 in 2019. Also, their general and administrative expenses jumped from $13 million in 2019 to $78 million in 2020. While some investors may argue that this business is taking on significant costs short-term so they can succeed in the long-term, I'm worried that heavy competition will slow down their growth. One final thing to note about their expenses is that currently they're losing money on the subscription plans that they offer as their subscriptions revenue was $184 million for 2020, while their subscriber related expenses totaled $204 million. Fubo is up against some strong competitors such as Google with their YouTube TV platform, Sling, Roku, and other streaming services. In the future, we'll see how those expenses change in relation to their revenue as they scale their new sports gambling business.
* Fubo reported reaching 547,880 subscribers in 2020 which was a result of them growing their subscriber base by 261,754 subscribers. As they scaled their subscriber base, average revenue per paying user increased by 17% YoY to $62.84 and total content hours streamed grew 82% YoY to 544.9 million hours. These numbers are impressive as well, but I question how much of that growth was a result of the Covid lockdowns. 2021 is the important year we're going to have to pay attention to in order to get an idea of how this company operates in more 'normal' times.
* The final things I want to mention about Fubo's finances has to do with their current ratio and goodwill. Fubo reported current asset and liabilities of $156 and $227 million respectively, which puts their current ratio at 0.6. For any company to have a current ratio of 0.6 is worrisome in my eyes. Additionally, if you go a bit down their balance sheet you will notice that their goodwill is $478 million. Goodwill arises when one company purchases another. Goodwill is an intangible asset that is calculated by subtracting the fair market value of one company's liabilities from the amount the acquiring company pays for it. The amount of goodwill we're seeing with Fubo is quite high considering their total assets would drop by 50% if they didn't measure it.

# Recent Developments/Acquisitions

* In January of 2021, Fubo announced that they will be acquiring the sports betting and iGaming company Vigtory. The CEO David Gandler stated that, ""We don't see wagering as simply an add-on product to fuboTV. Instead, we believe there is a real flywheel opportunity with streaming video content and interactivity."" I agree with this move made by the CEO as betting is a great compliment to their sports-first TV streaming platform. Fubo's sportsbook is expected to be released sometime mid 2021 and they could see adoption in three states by the end of the year. It'll be interesting to see how this all plays out considering the heavy competition in the sports betting market. Some of the biggest names in the sports betting market include DraftKings Inc (DKNG), Penn National Gaming (PENN), Bragg Gaming Group (BRGGF), and more.
* In April of 2021, Fubo announced they were acquiring the exclusive live streaming rights to the South American Qatar World Cup 2022 Qualifying Matches. CEO David Gandler said, ""By offering the best of South American soccer in advance of Qatar 2022, we are further differentiating FuboTV’s sports-first content portfolio enabling us to engage with more consumers than ever before.” Once again, I agree with the CEO and this move highlighted his dedication to making Fubo a sports streaming giant. This deal will help Fubo's brand name as this company will be advertising to millions of viewers. David is coming into the sports streaming market aggressively and investors will be awaiting to see how this acquisition will play out financially.
* In December of 2020, Fubo announced that they acquired Balto Sports. This deal marked Fubo's first move into the online wagering market. At the time the CEO was quoted saying, ""We believe there are significant synergies between consumers who enjoy wagering and our subscribers who enjoy streaming live sports, creating a flywheel opportunity. As we’ve previously expressed, one of our goals with wagering is to expand our total available market (TAM) by developing another important revenue stream for fuboTV, as we are doing with our growing ad sales business."" While I don't doubt the strong connection between sports wagering and Fubo's subscribers that enjoy streaming live sports, I question if the ad revenue investors are expecting will come to fruition.
* In April of 2020, Fubo announced the closing of their merger with the sports focused virtual entertainment company FaceBank Group. The CEO of Fubo had said, ""With today’s closing, fuboTV is well-positioned to redefine the virtual MVPD space. Technology-driven cable TV replacement services are more important than ever, especially at this time when people are staying safe at home watching television for needed information, entertainment and escape.” FaceBank is quite an interesting company and developed some unique projects such as the virtual Michael Jackson show at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards. This deal not only marked an interesting point in the development of Fubo, but gave the company access to $100 million in funding in the form of a revolving line of credit. I wonder as to how Fubo will leverage the virtual reality and live-entertainment technology that they now control.

# Management

CEO - **David Gandler**

David was appointed as the CEO and director of Fubo in April 2020. He has been part of the team since 2015 when Fubo was simply a streaming soccer service. Prior to his role at Fubo, Gandler worked in the advertising industry for over 15 years at companies such as Scripps Networks Interactive, Time Warner Cable Media Sales, and NBCUniversal's Telemundo Media. David has won a number of awards which includes *Goldman Sachs' 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs* (2019), *Variety's Dealmakers* (2020,2019), and *Broadcasting & Cable's Power 100* (2017). David's vision for what Fubo could become is interesting and the first of its kind. Looking forward I hope to see Gandler scale this company and integrate their acquisitions successfully. Undoubtedly, David has a grand vision for what could become one of the largest sports betting and streaming companies.

Co-Founder/CMO - **Alberto Horihuela**

Alberto is the co-founder and chief marketing officer at FuboTV and is in charge of their branding, user engagement and retention, and overall marketing vision. Prior to his co-founding of FuboTV, Alberto was head of Latin America at DramaFever (a video streaming provider). Alberto has an entrepreneurial spirit as he also co-founded Primerad Network, a digital video advertising company that connected brand marketers to Latin American audiences. In addition to his experience in marketing and entrepreneurship, Horihuela worked as an economist and analyst at Morgan Stanley and DeMatteo Monness. Both Gandler and Horihuela have extensive experience in marketing, entrepreneurship, and media to which should serve this company well going forward.

Management not mentioned: Simone Nardi (CFO), Mike Berkley (CPO), and Gina Sheldon (general counsel).

# What could go wrong

**Fubo can't keep up with the competition** \- As previously stated, Fubo is up against some heavy competition. AT&T TV provides more channels at the highest subscription level, but Fubo still offers more sports. Also , FuboTV's DVR only lets you record 250 hours of content while AT&T TV lets you record 500 hours of content. YouTube TV and Sling TV are two other competitors that are well equipped to steal market share from Fubo. The main differences I see between Fubo and the rest of the pact have to do with cost and product focus. Sling provides the cheapest plan which starts at $35 and is compatible with many of the existing streaming devices such as Apple TV, Xbox One, etc. In terms of the rest of the cohort, they all provide plans that are priced similarly. In terms of the products they offer, Sling, YouTube TV, and AT&T TV haven't differentiated themselves like Fubo. When it comes down to it, sports fans should gravitate to FuboTV as they provide the largest sports network. We'll have to see how this all plays out in the coming years to get to know which companies emerge as the leaders.

**Fubo fails to turn a profit** \- While this risk factor applies to any company that isn't profitable, it's important to highlight how early this company is to having a profitable business model. In their last earnings for the twelve months ended December 31st, Fubo posted $184 million of subscription revenue and $204 million in subscriber related expenses. Thus, this company is not making money on their services and I can't quite predict when or if this company will be profitable any time soon. That's not to say Fubo is a terrible service, but rather their financial standing isn't one that currently strikes me as sustainable.

# What we want to see in the future

**Contribution margin increasing** \- As noted in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 financial results, this company's contribution margin for 2020 was 10.1%. The contribution margin is the difference between subscriber revenue and what it costs Fubo to provide subscribers their service (ARPU - ACPU). While the contribution margin for this company sounds reasonable, the problem comes in when you factor expenses. Expenses such as sales and marketing, depreciation, technology and development, and a few others are hindering this company substantially from making a profit. Once you factor all the expenses of Fubo, they came in at an operating loss of $479 million. What we need to see from Fubo these next five years as they scale is them being able to at-least report a positive income from operations. Let's also remember that Fubo has a recurring revenue business model which means it is predictable and reliable.

**Fubo scales their sports gambling business** \- While this point is rather obvious, I wanted to note a few things about this side of Fubo's business so we can better understand it. Fubo has yet to roll out their sports betting business but they, ""expect to launch a sportsbook before the end of the year."" Certainly this is an exciting direction that this company is headed in. Although, we have no sort of guidance as to how this sports betting business will perform. CEO David Gandler was quoted saying, “We not only expect sports wagering to become a new line of business and source of revenue, but we also expect that it will increase user engagement on fuboTV resulting in higher ad monetization, better subscriber retention and reduced subscriber acquisition costs.” I like the way that David is thinking, but simply liking the idea doesn't make it a success. I can imagine investors will be eagerly watching how this venture performs in the first year of its integration. As for now, we don't really know what to expect.

# Analyst expectations

1. Predicted revenue range for 2021: $465.03 – 480.44 million (growth of roughly 110%)
2. Predicted earnings per share range for 2021 (EPS): $(2.5) – (0.82)

# TLDR

Fubo's vision to be a digital entertainment giant primarily focused on sports is innovative and unheard of. Their recent acquisitions of Vigtory and Balto Sports shows their commitment to making their goal a reality. While the CEO is thinking big, his ideas aren't translating well onto Fubo's financial statements. Their expenses have gone up at the same rate as their revenue has and that worries me. Additionally, this company isn't in the best cash position with $134 million. It's important to note that this company is still early in the process of what they're trying to accomplish and **I'll be keeping a close eye on how they perform this next yea**r. Their recurring revenue business model will surely serve them well in the future as it is predictable and reliable. You'll notice that the discounted cash flow is missing from this post and that is because forecasting this company's future growth is extremely difficult without some sort of idea as to what we can expect. As of right now, to put a price on this company is quite difficult.   


**In conclusion, I'll be watching Fubo's earnings this next year to get an idea of where this company is headed and if it's worth starting a position.**

myi5rn,3,14,StockMarket,$XL Fleet Technical Analysis and DD,0.86,1619415104.0,1619386304.0,"Alright folks, here's some DD and Technical Analysis on $XL (XL Fleet). Quick background, as some of you may know, $XL was the target of a short attack by Muddy Waters earlier this month, causing the price to crash nearly 75% from highs. This creates a huge buying opportunity for the new longs who get in during the rock bottom prices. Currently, the short interest on $XL is at its highest since January of this year, which allows for a potential squeeze to fuel the next run.

https://preview.redd.it/1ghfnebb1ev61.png?width=2618&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c383c27bf28d75d870ddfc7bfc38bb58b0f4039

I'm a fan of keeping the TA simple and not complicated, this allows for more predictable entries and exits imo. If you look at my chart, you can see that Just recently $XL broke out of its downward flag formation due to back to back positive news via PR. This trend breakout commonly results in a run up and retrace of the prior base level ($21ish in this case, ex: $ROKU, $BBBY, etc)). That's almost 3X (200%+) upside just based on pure technicals. Combined with the possibility of a short squeeze and we could see a pop to $30s or higher.

Now for the DD. The current marketcap for XL Fleet is just $1 billion. They have roughly $408 million in CASH on hand, with literally zero debt. That means they have almost HALF their marketcap in just cash, and can survive for many years at their current spending rate. This basically reduces the possibility of dilution or an offering being raised by XL Fleet and eliminates any bankruptcy concerns. The company itself has been in business since 2008 and has been consistently having sales and growing revenue + profit since inception. They just partnered with Dickinsons Fleet services, which will enable them to grow rapidly while committing to providing service and repair to all their ever growing electrified fleets. The best part about their business is that they are not limiting themselves to fleet electrification, they are also expanding to installing charging stations and fleet data intelligence. Those are two huge industries on their own as you can see by checking Chargepoint and other charging station companies marketcap and revenue. XL Fleet just won a contract to install 1000 charging stations at UBS arena, and if successful, will see many more to contracts like these to come.

The fundamentals combined with the EV industry being a hot topic in this administration will continue to propel the business and see it grow exponentially in the coming months and years. Their customer base includes companies like Verizon, Coca Cola, and many more. If they reach $21, their marketcap will still be just $3 billion in an ever growing speculative sector. I can see the company easily justifying a $5-6 billion marketcap which would put it around $35-42 range.

Overall, I feel like the short attack by Muddy Waters combined with the recent SPAC selloff generated a huge once in a while buying opportunity to get in super cheap on XL Fleet, with limited downside risk and significant upside potential. To me its like getting in $GME at rock bottom. I'm all in.

TLDR: I like the stock. I'm Long 8k shares and May 21 $11 calls.",2021-04-23

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 3 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! This week isn't as spicy as the last, but there's still buckets of money to be made regardless.

&nbsp;

I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- First and foremost, **expect extra volatility this week**. Many of the companies who report this week are *young*, and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their ""true"" values. Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies.

- **Be wary of solar plays**. Enphase got fucking *rocked* last week due to semiconductor shortages plaguing the sector, so such price action may be seen across the other solar stocks as well. That being said, following Enphases drop, many other solar stocks had sympathy drops, so these shortages may be priced in. Regardless, unless you've got some insider news, look to avoid them for now.

- This is kind of a no brainer, but **NKLA puts will print**. First and foremost, the company is a fraud. Second of all, following of ALL of it's earnings reports, NKLA has gone down every single time bar one, where it went up **0%**. You read that right. 0% was the most NKLA has risen following earnings. Sell credit spreads or buy puts. I've got no faith in Trevor Milton.

- **PENN Reports the day before Draftkings**. They usually follow very similar price movement, so you can use this to your advantage. If PENN puts up good numbers and goes up, you can almost guarentee that DKNG will do the same thing the following day when it reports.

- **Beyond Meat MOVES**. Similar to Enphase last week, BYND almost always craters or rockets following an earnings report. Personally, I would avoid this ticker, but the adrenaline junkies are more than welcome to run long strangles if they're within their personal risk tolerance. There's an awesome amount of money to be made here.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin’ companies, theres plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

# **More earnings, April’s big jobs report and inflation worries could swing markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/more-earnings-aprils-big-jobs-report-and-inflation-worries-could-swing-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> April’s jobs report and a barrage of earnings news make for another busy week for markets, as the calendar rolls into May.
*****
> Stocks notched solid gains in April, as REITs, consumer discretionary names and communications services companies outpaced the broader market, all more than 7% higher. However, April finished on a sour note, with stocks selling off on Friday.
*****
> “Since November, there’s been a 30% rally,” said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office. He noted that historically the November to April period is historically the strongest for stocks. “There’s the adage ‘sell in May, go away.’ It may be somewhat appropriate this year since we’ve done so well in the last six months.”
*****
> # Big jobs report
> April’s employment report is released Friday, and the market is expecting a big number.
*****
> Economists say payrolls in April could easily reach 1 million, after 916,000 jobs were added in March. Estimates range from about 700,000 to a forecast of 2.1 million from Jefferies economists.
*****
> According to Dow Jones, there is a consensus forecast of 978,000 among the economists it surveyed and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 5.8% form 6%.
*****
> Fed speakers will also be important after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in the past week that the Fed is still looking for “substantial further progress” in its goals for the economy.
*****
> The chairman emphasized that the Fed is not close to tapering back its bond buying program, a surprise to some investors. Some bond market pros had expected the Fed to start discussing cutting back purchases at its June meeting and begin to reduce its $120 billion monthly bond buying by the end of the year or early next year.
*****
> “Next week is all about the jobs number, because as part of the Fed’s path to ‘substantial progress’ on their two roles, we’ll see how much further along that path they are next Friday” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. The Fed’s mandate is to pursue full employment and a steady pace of Inflation, which it has targeted at 2%.
*****
> The Fed has expected a temporary period of high inflation which it expects to see subside later in the year though Boockvar and others say inflation could be hotter than the Fed expects. The core personal consumption expenditures price index jumped 0.36% in March, with the year-ago rate rising from 1.4% to 1.8%. It is expected to go even higher in April. Headline inflation in the consumer price index is expected to begin running at 3% or better when it is reported May 12.
*****
> Just days after Powell’s comments on tapering, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan Friday said the Fed should begin the discussion on paring back bond purchases because imbalances in financial markets and the economy is improving faster than expected.
*****
> The market’s focus on the Fed’s bond program makes the jobs report even more important. If the Fed starts to taper back those asset purchases, it would then signal it would be on the path toward raising interest rates. Most economists do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates before 2023.
*****
> “If this jobs number comes in super hot, it’s going to make people up their estimate on when the Fed might taper,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo.
*****
> Powell is among Fed speakers in the coming week, but he is not expected to provide any new views when he participates in a National Community Reinvestment Coalition conference Monday afternoon. Kaplan speaks Tuesday and Thursday, and New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are also among Fed officials speaking in the coming week.
*****
> # Earnings soar
> So far, a record 87% of S&P 500 companies have beat earnings estimates, and earnings look to be growing by more than 46%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub upped his forecast Friday for the S&P 500 based on strong earnings. “We are raising our 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4600 from 4300, representing 9.2% upside from current levels, and 22.5% for the year,” he wrote.
*****
> Earnings are expected from a diverse group of companies, from General Motors to ViacomCBS. Pharma will be in the spotlight as vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna both report. Draftkings and Beyond Meat are also on the schedule.
*****
> A host of travel related companies issue results, including Booking Holdings, Hilton Worldwide , Marriott Vacations, and Caesars Entertainment. Consumer brands, like Anheuser Busch Inbev and Estee Lauder also report, as do insurers including AIG, Allstate, and MetLife. (A calendar with some key earnings dates appears below.)
*****
> Chang said the market has discounted a lot of the positive news already.
*****
> “In spite of the really strong reports from the bellwether companies, you’re seeing some of the names starting to peter out a little bit,” said Chang. “I think it’s a sign that so much good news is discounted. I suspect the market is due for a breather. I think in the next couple of months, we’re likely to see sideways movement. There’s likely to be a pullback which will be healthy.”
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 5.2% in April, finishing Friday at 4,181. It is now up 11.2% for the year so far. The Dow rose 2.7% in April, to 33,874, and the Nasdaq gained 5.4% in April, ending Friday at 13,962.
*****
> Chang said he expects some of the “boring” blue chips that haven’t participated as much in the rally to do better. Some of those names can be found in pharma, he said.
*****
> Heading into the coming week, investors will be watching for words of wisdom from Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting Saturday.

> # S&P 500 and DJIA Up Last 9 Post-Election Year Mays

> May officially marks the beginning of the “Worst Six Months” for the DJIA and S&P. To wit: “Sell in May and go away.” Our “Best Six Months Switching Strategy,” created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader’s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $960,943 for November-April in 70 years compared to just $1,656 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 compounded to $788,997 for November-April in 70 years compared to a gain of just $10,145 for May-October.

> May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we once called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

> In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up twelve times in the past twenty-three years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down – 11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010.

> Post-election Year Mays rank near the top, registering average gains on DJIA and S&P 500 of 1.3% and 1.7% respectively. DJIA and S&P 500 have advanced in every post-election year May beginning in 1985. Russell 1000 has been up ten years straight in post-election year Mays.

> # S&P 500 Up Over 10% First Four Months – Preceded Flat May to late-October

> As of yesterday’s close, S&P 500 was up 11.5% year-to-date. Provided these gains hold through the end of April, this year will be just the seventeenth time since 1950 that the S&P 500 has finished the first four months of the year with a gain exceeding 10%. The best January to April span occurred in 1975, up 27.3% (S&P 500 was in the early stages of a new bull market following the bear ending 10/3/1974 in which the S&P 500 declined 48.2%). The next best year was, 1987 (most will remember what happened later that year) and the most recent year was 2019 (a solid year from beginning to end).

> In the above chart we have plotted all 17 previous years in which the S&P 500 was up over 10% January through the end of April. Along side for comparison is “All Years,” “Post-Election Years,” and 2021 through yesterday. In the previous 17 years, gains tended to fizzle in early-May before gaining some additional ground from around mid-June to mid-July before once again stalling out till late September with more weakness lasting until late-October. On average, by late-October arrived, gains from the previous three months were given back and since the start of May S&P 500 gained around 2.5% on average. You don’t have to go away in May but considering the historically modest gains from early-May to late-October, it may not quite be worth sticking around.

> # Here Comes Sell In May

> “The sun was warm but the wind was chill. You know how it is with an April day. When the sun is out and the wind is still, you’re one month on in the middle of May.” American Poet Robert Frost

> One of the best known investment axioms is to “sell in May and go away.” This is largely because the six months from May through October have historically been some of the weakest months of the year for stocks. As you can see below, the next six months have tended to be on the weak side.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the next six months have indeed been the worst six months of the year, up only 1.7% on average. To add insult to injury, we are leaving the six most bullish months of the year. In fact, the S&P 500 Index is set to gain close to 30% during these most bullish six months, one of the best six-month gains ever.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “Stocks are up more than 87% from the March lows, suggesting a well-deserved pullback during these troublesome months is quite possible,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with an accommodative Fed, fiscal and monetary policy, along with an economy that is opening faster than nearly anyone expected, we’d use any weakness as an opportunity to add to positions.”

> Here’s the catch, isn’t there always a catch? Stocks have actually been higher during these worst months of the year eight of the past ten years.

> # U.S. Economy Jumps Out of the Gate in 2021

> In what was initially expected to be one of the slower quarters of the year, the U.S. economy jumped out of the gates in 2021, with gross domestic product (GDP) growing 6.4% quarter over quarter. A faster than expected vaccination program, nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus—including direct payments to consumers—and faster than expected job growth helped fuel a surge in personal consumption—the largest portion of GDP.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, personal consumption grew 10.7% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, the second highest level since the 1960’s:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “The U.S. economy is off to a great start in 2021, and this should set the stage for solid growth in the remainder of the year as pent up demand continues to flow through the economy,” added LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Many areas of the country are still facing restrictions on activity, so we don’t think growth will just be limited to the first quarter.”

> However, the growth story in the first quarter wasn’t solely about direct stimulus payments. While personal consumption has understandably gained a lot of attention, federal non-defense spending added the most to GDP in nearly 60 years, a segment of the economy unaffected by transfer payments like stimulus checks.

> Digging into the numbers even further, spending on services grew a modest 4.6%, which should accelerate in the second and third quarters as remaining restrictions are lifted in response to falling cases and rising vaccinations. As of April 28, the US is averaging around 2.5-3 million vaccines administered per day, which has helped over half the adult population receive at least one dose of the vaccine, while nearly 40% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

> The U.S. vaccination program has helped pull the economy forward, but net trade was a modest drag on growth in the first quarter, where domestic growth pulled in imports at a faster pace than the recovery outside of the U.S. lifted exports. As the rest of the world gets better control of COVID-19, rebounding economic growth overseas should provide an additional tailwind for U.S. economy.

> We upgraded our forecast for U.S. GDP in our recent Weekly Market Commentary from 5–5.5% to 6.25–6.75%, and we expect to see the economy continue its pace in the second quarter as restrictions are lifted and activity normalizes.

> # Where Do President Biden’s First 100 Days Stack Up Versus President Trump?

> President Biden’s 100th day in office is tomorrow, on April 29. Hard to believe it has been 100 days already, but overall the economy continues to improve and stocks have done very well under our new President.

> We’ve heard the question many times: Where does the Biden rally rank? That is what we will look at today. The term “hundred days” was first used on July 24, 1933, on the radio by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). He was discussing the 100-day session of the 73rd U.S. Congress, but over time this term has changed to refer to the first 100 days of a new president.

> Per Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist, “President Biden has been quite kind for stocks, with the Dow up nearly 10%, which is on pace for the best first 100 days in office since FDR in the early 1930s. Then toss in the cherry on top that stocks had one of their greatest rallies ever from Election Day until the inauguration and it is clear that although maybe everyone might not like President Biden, but the stock market doesn’t have many issues with him.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has averaged 4.3% the first 100 days of a new President, while it has been higher the first 100 days in office for five of the past six Presidents. In fact, President Biden’s return currently ranks as the third best since 1900, with only Taft and Roosevelt better. Lastly, breaking it down by political party and the first 100 days under a Democratic President was much stronger, up 10.3% on average versus down 0.2% for a Republican President.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Here’s a chart we shared earlier this year that shows that stocks did amazingly well from Election Day until the inauguration under President Biden.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> What can we glean from those first 100 days? Is there any pattern that might suggest how stocks will do during the rest of the time President Biden is in office? You can look for yourself below, but there doesn’t appear to be any clue as to what might happen. President Eisenhower had a weak first 100 days, then a big rally over the remainder of his time in office. Conversely, President Taft saw a big rally during the first 100 days, only to have negative returns for the remainder of his time in office. In the end, fundamentals, valuations, and technicals drive long-term equity returns. The good news is only once since the Great Depression did that mean lower returns for the remainder of time in office after the first 100 days.

> # Wild Data Close To Q1

> Today was quite the day for economic data, with two key releases from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We'll start with BEA data on personal income and spending in March.

> First, as shown below, the savings rate surged in the month, with households saving 27.6% of personal income net of taxes. That's a huge number, even by the standards of the elevated savings rates that we've seen over the course of the pandemic.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-1.png))**

> The reason there was so much saving going on is that transfer payments rose by more than $300bn on the month, driven by the delivery of economic impact payments also known as ""stimulus checks"" or even shorter: ""stimmies.""

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-2.png))**

> Incomes also rose thanks to rebounding labor market activity following winter storms in Texas during February and the longer-term trend of reopening across the economy. As shown, the 13.5% annualized growth of wage and salary income in the month was very strong. It was also helped along by wage growth, which we will discuss later on.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-3.png))**

> With spending surging thanks to stimulus checks and other factors, core personal consumption expenditure prices surged by the most MoM since 2009, over 4% annualized. The 4% move was in no small part due to the swing in activity from February to March, and isn't likely to be sustained, but it is a helpful indicator that prices may be more robust in this recovery than they were during the low inflation post-GFC period.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-4.png))**

> For broad inflation that will concern the Fed, one factor that will be needed along with steadily rising prices is strong wage growth. The second big report today was Q1 wages in the BLS Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI does a better job of measuring wage growth than other series because it accounts for changes in the composition of employment over time. As shown in the chart below, Q3 saw the strongest sequential wage growth on record, with a 4.6% annualized advance in wages versus Q4. Some of that came from incentive-paid occupations, which benefit from bonuses and related payments, skewing the results. As shown in the chart, though, there was very strong wage growth even excluding incentive-paid occupations. Anecdotal reports of very tight labor markets amidst booming reopening demand got support from this release.

# **More earnings, April’s big jobs report and inflation worries could swing markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/more-earnings-aprils-big-jobs-report-and-inflation-worries-could-swing-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> April’s jobs report and a barrage of earnings news make for another busy week for markets, as the calendar rolls into May.
*****
> Stocks notched solid gains in April, as REITs, consumer discretionary names and communications services companies outpaced the broader market, all more than 7% higher. However, April finished on a sour note, with stocks selling off on Friday.
*****
> “Since November, there’s been a 30% rally,” said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office. He noted that historically the November to April period is historically the strongest for stocks. “There’s the adage ‘sell in May, go away.’ It may be somewhat appropriate this year since we’ve done so well in the last six months.”
*****
> # Big jobs report
> April’s employment report is released Friday, and the market is expecting a big number.
*****
> Economists say payrolls in April could easily reach 1 million, after 916,000 jobs were added in March. Estimates range from about 700,000 to a forecast of 2.1 million from Jefferies economists.
*****
> According to Dow Jones, there is a consensus forecast of 978,000 among the economists it surveyed and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 5.8% form 6%.
*****
> Fed speakers will also be important after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in the past week that the Fed is still looking for “substantial further progress” in its goals for the economy.
*****
> The chairman emphasized that the Fed is not close to tapering back its bond buying program, a surprise to some investors. Some bond market pros had expected the Fed to start discussing cutting back purchases at its June meeting and begin to reduce its $120 billion monthly bond buying by the end of the year or early next year.
*****
> “Next week is all about the jobs number, because as part of the Fed’s path to ‘substantial progress’ on their two roles, we’ll see how much further along that path they are next Friday” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. The Fed’s mandate is to pursue full employment and a steady pace of Inflation, which it has targeted at 2%.
*****
> The Fed has expected a temporary period of high inflation which it expects to see subside later in the year though Boockvar and others say inflation could be hotter than the Fed expects. The core personal consumption expenditures price index jumped 0.36% in March, with the year-ago rate rising from 1.4% to 1.8%. It is expected to go even higher in April. Headline inflation in the consumer price index is expected to begin running at 3% or better when it is reported May 12.
*****
> Just days after Powell’s comments on tapering, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan Friday said the Fed should begin the discussion on paring back bond purchases because imbalances in financial markets and the economy is improving faster than expected.
*****
> The market’s focus on the Fed’s bond program makes the jobs report even more important. If the Fed starts to taper back those asset purchases, it would then signal it would be on the path toward raising interest rates. Most economists do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates before 2023.
*****
> “If this jobs number comes in super hot, it’s going to make people up their estimate on when the Fed might taper,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo.
*****
> Powell is among Fed speakers in the coming week, but he is not expected to provide any new views when he participates in a National Community Reinvestment Coalition conference Monday afternoon. Kaplan speaks Tuesday and Thursday, and New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are also among Fed officials speaking in the coming week.
*****
> # Earnings soar
> So far, a record 87% of S&P 500 companies have beat earnings estimates, and earnings look to be growing by more than 46%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub upped his forecast Friday for the S&P 500 based on strong earnings. “We are raising our 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4600 from 4300, representing 9.2% upside from current levels, and 22.5% for the year,” he wrote.
*****
> Earnings are expected from a diverse group of companies, from General Motors to ViacomCBS. Pharma will be in the spotlight as vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna both report. Draftkings and Beyond Meat are also on the schedule.
*****
> A host of travel related companies issue results, including Booking Holdings, Hilton Worldwide , Marriott Vacations, and Caesars Entertainment. Consumer brands, like Anheuser Busch Inbev and Estee Lauder also report, as do insurers including AIG, Allstate, and MetLife. (A calendar with some key earnings dates appears below.)
*****
> Chang said the market has discounted a lot of the positive news already.
*****
> “In spite of the really strong reports from the bellwether companies, you’re seeing some of the names starting to peter out a little bit,” said Chang. “I think it’s a sign that so much good news is discounted. I suspect the market is due for a breather. I think in the next couple of months, we’re likely to see sideways movement. There’s likely to be a pullback which will be healthy.”
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 5.2% in April, finishing Friday at 4,181. It is now up 11.2% for the year so far. The Dow rose 2.7% in April, to 33,874, and the Nasdaq gained 5.4% in April, ending Friday at 13,962.
*****
> Chang said he expects some of the “boring” blue chips that haven’t participated as much in the rally to do better. Some of those names can be found in pharma, he said.
*****
> Heading into the coming week, investors will be watching for words of wisdom from Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting Saturday.

> # S&P 500 and DJIA Up Last 9 Post-Election Year Mays

> May officially marks the beginning of the “Worst Six Months” for the DJIA and S&P. To wit: “Sell in May and go away.” Our “Best Six Months Switching Strategy,” created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader’s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $960,943 for November-April in 70 years compared to just $1,656 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 compounded to $788,997 for November-April in 70 years compared to a gain of just $10,145 for May-October.

> May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”. It used to be part of what we once called the “May/June disaster area.” From 1965 to 1984 the S&P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.

> In the years since 1997, May’s performance has been erratic; DJIA up twelve times in the past twenty-three years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down – 11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010.

> Post-election Year Mays rank near the top, registering average gains on DJIA and S&P 500 of 1.3% and 1.7% respectively. DJIA and S&P 500 have advanced in every post-election year May beginning in 1985. Russell 1000 has been up ten years straight in post-election year Mays.

> # S&P 500 Up Over 10% First Four Months – Preceded Flat May to late-October

> As of yesterday’s close, S&P 500 was up 11.5% year-to-date. Provided these gains hold through the end of April, this year will be just the seventeenth time since 1950 that the S&P 500 has finished the first four months of the year with a gain exceeding 10%. The best January to April span occurred in 1975, up 27.3% (S&P 500 was in the early stages of a new bull market following the bear ending 10/3/1974 in which the S&P 500 declined 48.2%). The next best year was, 1987 (most will remember what happened later that year) and the most recent year was 2019 (a solid year from beginning to end).

> In the above chart we have plotted all 17 previous years in which the S&P 500 was up over 10% January through the end of April. Along side for comparison is “All Years,” “Post-Election Years,” and 2021 through yesterday. In the previous 17 years, gains tended to fizzle in early-May before gaining some additional ground from around mid-June to mid-July before once again stalling out till late September with more weakness lasting until late-October. On average, by late-October arrived, gains from the previous three months were given back and since the start of May S&P 500 gained around 2.5% on average. You don’t have to go away in May but considering the historically modest gains from early-May to late-October, it may not quite be worth sticking around.

> # Here Comes Sell In May

> “The sun was warm but the wind was chill. You know how it is with an April day. When the sun is out and the wind is still, you’re one month on in the middle of May.” American Poet Robert Frost

> One of the best known investment axioms is to “sell in May and go away.” This is largely because the six months from May through October have historically been some of the weakest months of the year for stocks. As you can see below, the next six months have tended to be on the weak side.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the next six months have indeed been the worst six months of the year, up only 1.7% on average. To add insult to injury, we are leaving the six most bullish months of the year. In fact, the S&P 500 Index is set to gain close to 30% during these most bullish six months, one of the best six-month gains ever.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “Stocks are up more than 87% from the March lows, suggesting a well-deserved pullback during these troublesome months is quite possible,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with an accommodative Fed, fiscal and monetary policy, along with an economy that is opening faster than nearly anyone expected, we’d use any weakness as an opportunity to add to positions.”

> Here’s the catch, isn’t there always a catch? Stocks have actually been higher during these worst months of the year eight of the past ten years.

> # U.S. Economy Jumps Out of the Gate in 2021

> In what was initially expected to be one of the slower quarters of the year, the U.S. economy jumped out of the gates in 2021, with gross domestic product (GDP) growing 6.4% quarter over quarter. A faster than expected vaccination program, nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus—including direct payments to consumers—and faster than expected job growth helped fuel a surge in personal consumption—the largest portion of GDP.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, personal consumption grew 10.7% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, the second highest level since the 1960’s:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “The U.S. economy is off to a great start in 2021, and this should set the stage for solid growth in the remainder of the year as pent up demand continues to flow through the economy,” added LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Many areas of the country are still facing restrictions on activity, so we don’t think growth will just be limited to the first quarter.”

> However, the growth story in the first quarter wasn’t solely about direct stimulus payments. While personal consumption has understandably gained a lot of attention, federal non-defense spending added the most to GDP in nearly 60 years, a segment of the economy unaffected by transfer payments like stimulus checks.

> Digging into the numbers even further, spending on services grew a modest 4.6%, which should accelerate in the second and third quarters as remaining restrictions are lifted in response to falling cases and rising vaccinations. As of April 28, the US is averaging around 2.5-3 million vaccines administered per day, which has helped over half the adult population receive at least one dose of the vaccine, while nearly 40% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

> The U.S. vaccination program has helped pull the economy forward, but net trade was a modest drag on growth in the first quarter, where domestic growth pulled in imports at a faster pace than the recovery outside of the U.S. lifted exports. As the rest of the world gets better control of COVID-19, rebounding economic growth overseas should provide an additional tailwind for U.S. economy.

> We upgraded our forecast for U.S. GDP in our recent Weekly Market Commentary from 5–5.5% to 6.25–6.75%, and we expect to see the economy continue its pace in the second quarter as restrictions are lifted and activity normalizes.

> # Where Do President Biden’s First 100 Days Stack Up Versus President Trump?

> President Biden’s 100th day in office is tomorrow, on April 29. Hard to believe it has been 100 days already, but overall the economy continues to improve and stocks have done very well under our new President.

> We’ve heard the question many times: Where does the Biden rally rank? That is what we will look at today. The term “hundred days” was first used on July 24, 1933, on the radio by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). He was discussing the 100-day session of the 73rd U.S. Congress, but over time this term has changed to refer to the first 100 days of a new president.

> Per Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist, “President Biden has been quite kind for stocks, with the Dow up nearly 10%, which is on pace for the best first 100 days in office since FDR in the early 1930s. Then toss in the cherry on top that stocks had one of their greatest rallies ever from Election Day until the inauguration and it is clear that although maybe everyone might not like President Biden, but the stock market doesn’t have many issues with him.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has averaged 4.3% the first 100 days of a new President, while it has been higher the first 100 days in office for five of the past six Presidents. In fact, President Biden’s return currently ranks as the third best since 1900, with only Taft and Roosevelt better. Lastly, breaking it down by political party and the first 100 days under a Democratic President was much stronger, up 10.3% on average versus down 0.2% for a Republican President.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Here’s a chart we shared earlier this year that shows that stocks did amazingly well from Election Day until the inauguration under President Biden.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> What can we glean from those first 100 days? Is there any pattern that might suggest how stocks will do during the rest of the time President Biden is in office? You can look for yourself below, but there doesn’t appear to be any clue as to what might happen. President Eisenhower had a weak first 100 days, then a big rally over the remainder of his time in office. Conversely, President Taft saw a big rally during the first 100 days, only to have negative returns for the remainder of his time in office. In the end, fundamentals, valuations, and technicals drive long-term equity returns. The good news is only once since the Great Depression did that mean lower returns for the remainder of time in office after the first 100 days.

> # Wild Data Close To Q1

> Today was quite the day for economic data, with two key releases from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We'll start with BEA data on personal income and spending in March.

> First, as shown below, the savings rate surged in the month, with households saving 27.6% of personal income net of taxes. That's a huge number, even by the standards of the elevated savings rates that we've seen over the course of the pandemic.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-1.png))**

> The reason there was so much saving going on is that transfer payments rose by more than $300bn on the month, driven by the delivery of economic impact payments also known as ""stimulus checks"" or even shorter: ""stimmies.""

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-2.png))**

> Incomes also rose thanks to rebounding labor market activity following winter storms in Texas during February and the longer-term trend of reopening across the economy. As shown, the 13.5% annualized growth of wage and salary income in the month was very strong. It was also helped along by wage growth, which we will discuss later on.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-3.png))**

> With spending surging thanks to stimulus checks and other factors, core personal consumption expenditure prices surged by the most MoM since 2009, over 4% annualized. The 4% move was in no small part due to the swing in activity from February to March, and isn't likely to be sustained, but it is a helpful indicator that prices may be more robust in this recovery than they were during the low inflation post-GFC period.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-4.png))**

> For broad inflation that will concern the Fed, one factor that will be needed along with steadily rising prices is strong wage growth. The second big report today was Q1 wages in the BLS Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI does a better job of measuring wage growth than other series because it accounts for changes in the composition of employment over time. As shown in the chart below, Q3 saw the strongest sequential wage growth on record, with a 4.6% annualized advance in wages versus Q4. Some of that came from incentive-paid occupations, which benefit from bonuses and related payments, skewing the results. As shown in the chart, though, there was very strong wage growth even excluding incentive-paid occupations. Anecdotal reports of very tight labor markets amidst booming reopening demand got support from this release.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 3 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! This week isn't as spicy as the last, but there's still buckets of money to be made regardless.

I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing)

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- First and foremost, **expect extra volatility this week**. Many of the companies who report this week are *young*, and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their ""true"" values. Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies.

- **Be wary of solar plays**. Enphase got fucking *rocked* last week due to semiconductor shortages plaguing the sector, so such price action may be seen across the other solar stocks as well. That being said, following Enphases drop, many other solar stocks had sympathy drops, so these shortages may be priced in. Regardless, unless you've got some insider news, look to avoid them for now.

- This is kind of a no brainer, but **NKLA puts will print**. First and foremost, the company is a fraud. Second of all, following of ALL of it's earnings reports, NKLA has gone down every single time bar one, where it went up **0%**. You read that right. 0% was the most NKLA has risen following earnings. Sell credit spreads or buy puts. I've got no faith in Trevor Milton.

- **PENN Reports the day before Draftkings**. They usually follow very similar price movement, so you can use this to your advantage. If PENN puts up good numbers and goes up, you can almost guarentee that DKNG will do the same thing the following day when it reports.

- **Beyond Meat MOVES**. Similar to Enphase last week, BYND almost always craters or rockets following an earnings report. Personally, I would avoid this ticker, but the adrenaline junkies are more than welcome to run long strangles if they're within their personal risk tolerance. There's an awesome amount of money to be made here.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin’ companies, theres plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

**Week of 5/3/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 5/3/21 at 4205.86, above the previous close of 4181.61 on Friday 4/30/21.

Manufacturing numbers release early in the week, with the April Markit Manufacturing PMI released Monday, and trade deficit & factory orders numbers for March releasing Tuesday, May 4th. Markit services PMI and ISM services index numbers for April release Wednesday, and productivity & labor costs for Q1 release Thursday. The ADP Employment report for April releases Wednesday, and weekly jobless claims numbers release Thursday, May 6th. April unemployment rates release Friday, as well as nonfarm payrolls, and average hourly earnings.

The average cost to build a home skyrocketed by $36,000 according to the National Association of Homebuilders. The rising prices are likely associated with soaring lumber costs. Lumber futures are up 125% on a 6-month basis. REITs reflected the change, rising throughout April. March construction numbers release Monday at 10AM.

Verizon has reached an agreement with Apollo Global Management to sell its Verizon Media platform, which consists of internet pioneers Yahoo and AOL. The agreement to sell the tech platforms to the private equity firm will be worth $5 Billion. As a stipulation of the agreement Verizon will maintain a 10% stake in the new company, which Apollo plans to call “Yahoo.” Apollo releases earnings on Monday, May 3rd.

Chip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020’s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand.

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.GM reports earnings on Wednesday and markets will be curious to see if the chip shortage has affected them. Despite supply chain concerns CNBC’s Jim Cramer was optimistic in his recent review of the company, saying “If you want to bet on electric vehicles with much less risk, I say buy some Ford or General Motors… these are huge, established companies with improving balance sheets and real earnings, earnings that happen to be skyrocketing right now...”

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders in April to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reported earnings of $1.40 per share on Wednesday, April 28th, exceeding analyst estimates of $0.98 after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year Wednesday April 21st, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

Microsoft reported earnings of $1.95 per share Tuesday, April 27th, beating analyst estimates of $1.78 by a small margin. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.

Analysts had anticipated a net loss of 13 cents a share. Roku’s net revenue of $574.2 million was up 79% year-over-year, beating out consensus estimates at $491.6 million.

ROKU has been caught in a pretty nasty selloff since early Feb. Up 9% after hours making up more than the day's 6.5% loss.

PS you can pry my ROKU shares out of my cold dead fingers.",2021-05-06
n6bafa,6,17,options,Delta-Neutral Trading: A Trial Run on UBER,0.86,1620347343.0,1620318543.0,"Given the volatility around earnings this past month, and the market in general I decided to test out a delta neutral trade  I've wanted to do for real for a very long time but never saw a good opportunity for.

&#x200B;

**The Trade**: Buy 1 long call ATM, sell shares to flatten the delta accordingly.

**Best Scenario** (what I looked for): A company with relatively low IV, in comparison to the past year in between earnings, that had not begun to rise leading up to this quarter's earnings report. I found 2 prime candidates fitting that description, ROKU and UBER. Because this was a trial run I used UBER because of its lower cost.

&#x200B;

**The Goal**: Create a delta-neutral position that would profit from the vega, and IV rising, while losing slightly on theta on the course of 1-2 days. (Trade was opened Monday 5/3, earnings were after hours Wed. 5/5).

**How it Wins**: IV rises more than the loss of theta, in this case at least 0.5%. I didn’t write down the starting theta but it was about -3.8.

**How it Loses**: IV falls, or stays still, and theta builds up a loss over the time held.

&#x200B;

**Opening the trade**: At 11:51 on 5/3, I bought 1 UBER 55 C expiring 18 JUN 21 (46 DTE, and ATM) for 3.75. Share price was at $55.2 and IV was at 51.54%.

I then immediately sold 54 shares for $55.19 a share.

The Delta at open was -0.30, basically flat, and the Vega was 7.84. As mentioned above Theta was about -3.80.

**Closing the Trade**: After holding overnight, Tuesday resulted in a spike in IV, up to 54% exactly, obviously across the board and throughout the market as a whole. UBER shares fell and I bought them back for

$52.61. The profit on the short shares was $139.32.  The call was also then sold for 2.61, a loss of $114.

The resulting profit was $25.32. Over margin (3,355.26 from the shares and call combined) this was a 0.75% return in one day. If I held through the rest of Tuesday, IV would have reached 55%, gaining about $7.8 more, which would amount to a 1% gain.

Obviously that’s not a great return, but it’s a useful strategy for quick returns when direction is uncertain but uncertainty is certain. Also, this size of this trade is very small and could be easily increased with larger ticker or more contracts.

Hope this was interesting/useful.",2021-05-06
n78n3g,4,35,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 7, 2021",0.87,1620449458.0,1620420658.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 7, 2021**

Keeping up with current volatility, the stock market jumped up today to new records, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) reaching fresh intraday records, driven higher by a swift reversal to the upside by tech-stocks. Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings reports and the disappointing April Jobs Report, which showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected even despite the easing of social distancing guidelines. 

The Labor Department showed that the US only brought back 266,000 jobs for the month of April, far less than the gain of at least 1 million that was originally expected and a big deceleration from the numbers seen in March. The unemployment rate unexpectedly increased to 6.1%, widening further from its pre-pandemic level of 3.5%. 

This new economic data serves to bolster the argument that monetary officials have been making that, despite significant progress, the labor market remains well below pre-pandemic levels and that more support from the Central Bank is needed to bolster the momentum of the recovery. Altogether, the US remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation remains well below January 2020.

In the past, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has suggested the Central Bank wants to see a “string” of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million before any adjustment to the current policy is made. With the April report disappointing, it appeared the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets, meaning it is unlikely to change its current accommodative policy anytime soon.

Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors said, “The smaller rise in payrolls should at least assuage some concerns around the Fed policy outlook. As we have heard several times in recent days, even a very strong jobs number wouldn’t have caused the committee to formally discuss changing the pace of bond purchases, so today’s number certainly won’t be giving the Fed cause for concern. They will be in no rush to bring forward tapering plans.""

Vizio is the second largest TV manufacturer in the United States (15% market share) and THE largest for soundbars (14% market share) with $2 billion in annual revenue. 

The company had the crappy luck of going public a few weeks ago during the March 2021 tech-selloff and faced a very tough IPO market anyways. The company's reputation as a hardware company is masking its small, but rapidly growing and extremely profitable advertising business that has grown at over 100% a year since it was established in 2018.

With its large market share in TVs, Vizio is finally ramping up its opportunity to monetize the millions of daily users of its SmartCast operating system (found on every Vizio television for you smooth-brains with Samsung). Essentially, they are getting paid every time someone turns on the TV and more (which again in this crowd, is a lot of you lardos). 

To put the contrasting economics into perspective, in 2020, the hardware business had 10% gross margins, contributed to 93% of total sales and 62% of total gross profit, and grew 7% YoY. Meanwhile, the platform/advertising business had 76% gross margins (up from 60% in 2018), contributed to only 7% of total sales but 38% of total gross profit, and grew at 132% YoY. At its current market cap of $4 billion, Vizio trades at 2x sales, less than 20x forward earnings, and has over $300 million in cash with no debt. As investor awareness improves regarding the high growth software platform, the stock's multiple should expand and narrow the valuation gap vs. peers like Roku. Shares are easily worth 2x to 4x the current price.

FUBO was caught in the Archegos drama and has had their SP literally crushed in the past few weeks.

Before the HwangBang there was a reporting error that sent the SP dropping into Gulag. The previous report didnt factor in GAAP and also did not take into account dilution, resulting in a dramatically high EPS miss. Even with massive sub growth larger than ROKU and NFLX they got their shit kicked in.

Now, the company has been in a ""quiet period"" for weeks, meaning they cannot comment on anything regarding acquisitions or any material information until the period is over per SEC rules.

That period ends in 45 mins.

FUBO is the number 1 sports streaming platform, and is rolling out sports betting in Q4, and has the most impressive sub growth of all streaming services % wise. Theyre introducing original content to offer alongside Live TV.

ALL analysts covering the stock are projecting $40-$60 and institutional buying is the highest ive ever seen in the last 2 months on any stock.

&#x200B;

Theyre presenting at the Annual Needham Virtual Growth Conference on 5/17. Theyre edge over DKNG is that they can legally share all analytics they collect via their betting platform, which DKNG cannot do via privacy laws since theyre technically a 3rd party, whereas FUBO does it in house.

**Outlook/Game Plan:** I mentioned yesterday that the next support on SPY was at the 50 day moving average and thats exactly where price stopped selling off, right at 404 on the penny. Now pre market the SPY is trying to hold the 50 day moving average. I'm honestly not sure if the 50 will hold or not as there is still plenty of room to pull back (the 200 dma is at 369) It feels like the market has been selling off for months not. Not the indices but individual stocks, It's almost the opposite of last year but what goes up must come down. Many stocks are approaching very low areas, are getting oversold so hopefully in the next few weeks here we can get some nice moves back higher. If you were trading oil stocks yesterday or penny stocks you probably did ok because Energy led the market. Plan today is to stay focused, and trade solid patterns, concentrating on minimizing risk and trading stocks with good catalyst. I'll most likely run a scan at the open to make sure I'm in the right place. Good luck out there!

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy.",2021-05-20

Intraday action was fantastic, most setups worked and there plenty of great opportunities. Tons of gap ups pre market. Usually big gap days in the market especially when there are hundreds of gapping stocks leads to profit taking at the open but today could be different because the SPY will probably open at all time highs which is very bullish after being lower for the past month. I will be prepared for anything, and as always look for opportunities long and short if the setups present themselves. If things look too good, I will try to slow myself down a bit, my worst days are almost always on the days where things look too good, I get too aggressive only to get my ass kicked.

$XL Technical Analysis and DD

Alright my fellow apes, here's some DD and Technical Analysis on $XL (XL Fleet). Quick background, as some of you may know, $XL was the target of a short attack by Muddy Waters earlier this month, causing the price to crash nearly 75% from highs. This creates a huge buying opportunity for the new longs who get in during the rock bottom prices. Currently, the short interest on $XL is at its highest since January of this year, which allows for a potential squeeze to fuel the next run.

https://preview.redd.it/vk53t58z6ev61.png?width=2618&format=png&auto=webp&s=15f100209c32d6478097bd5dcd3cc87161d878e5

I'm a fan of keeping the TA simple and not complicated, this allows for more predictable entries and exits imo. If you look at my chart, you can see that Just recently $XL broke out of its downward flag formation due to back to back positive news via PR. This trend breakout commonly results in a run up and retrace of the prior base level ($21ish in this case, ex: $ROKU, $BBBY, etc)). That's almost 3X (200%+) upside just based on pure technicals. Combined with the possibility of a short squeeze and we could see a pop to $30s or higher.

Now for the DD. The current marketcap for XL Fleet is just $1 billion. They have roughly $408 million in CASH on hand, with literally zero debt. That means they have almost HALF their marketcap in just cash, and can survive for many years at their current spending rate. This basically reduces the possibility of dilution or an offering being raised by XL Fleet and eliminates any bankruptcy concerns. The company itself has been in business since 2008 and has been consistently having sales and growing revenue + profit since inception. They just partnered with Dickinsons Fleet services, which will enable them to grow rapidly while committing to providing service and repair to all their ever growing electrified fleets. The best part about their business is that they are not limiting themselves to fleet electrification, they are also expanding to installing charging stations and fleet data intelligence. Those are two huge industries on their own as you can see by checking Chargepoint and other charging station companies marketcap and revenue. XL Fleet just won a contract to install 1000 charging stations at UBS arena, and if successful, will see many more to contracts like these to come.

The fundamentals combined with the EV industry being a hot topic in this administration will continue to propel the business and see it grow exponentially in the coming months and years. Their customer base includes companies like Verizon, Coca Cola, and many more. If they reach $21, their marketcap will still be just $3 billion in an ever growing speculative sector. I can see the company easily justifying a $5-6 billion marketcap which would put it around $35-42 range.

Overall, I feel like the short attack by Muddy Waters combined with the recent SPAC selloff generated a huge once in a while buying opportunity to get in super cheap on XL Fleet, with limited downside risk and significant upside potential. To me its like getting in $GME at rock bottom. I'm all in.

TLDR: I like the stock. YOLOd my life savings (100k) in XL shares",2021-06-08

nzz59n,134,850,Daytrading,Some More Tips On Day Trading,0.99,1623710595.0,1623710595.0,"In the past I have posted various tips and strategies to help one in their Day Trading.   

I honestly believe in giving back to a community that you have prospered in - so that is the only reason I am here.  This is a hard field to get into and a difficult journey for most.  The reward at the end is definitely worth it, but the road there is filled with scams, pitfalls, losses and frustration.  If I can help any of you avoid some of what I and others had to face, I am happy to assist.

Also please know that while there are resources I recommend, I do not benefit or work for any service, channel or platform.  My recommendations are my personal opinion based on what I have experienced, nothing more. I detest scams and hate the schills pushing those scams even more.  I am an independent trader who trades with my own money.

Hopefully some of you were able to get in on WOOF, AAPL, DOCU and ROKU longs today, or WYNN, FCX and CLX shorts.  They all followed Relative Strength and Weakness against SPY strategy and were slam-dunk trades.

OK - some other tips in addition to those I already posted:

**1) Don't Trade Your P&L, Trade the Charts** \- When it comes to the question of ""When should I exit?"" your answer should be - based on the charts, not how much you are up or down on the trade.  You never want to be making decisions out of fear of loss or greed.  I exit a trade when the logic behind originally taking the trade no longer applies.  Stocks will retrace but as long as it doesn't violate the why you got into the trade to begin with, there usually isn't a good reason to exit other than watching your P&L.  Exit based on the technicals and you will find your win rate increase dramatically.

**2) Focus on Win Rate -** Yes, I know the argument - one can have a 95% win rate and still lose money if they blow it all on that 5%.  However, this should not happen if you are applying the same rules to every trade.  When your strategy isn't working and you exit, the loss should not be so much that it overcomes many wins.  The most important thing you can do is have a solid strategy that maintains a win rate of 80%.  The best way to get to that point, no matter how much is in your account, is to practice your strategy with a very small position size, I am talking only a few shares, one contract on options, etc.  (this will also help you practice not focusing on the P&L).  Do not increase your position size until you get that win rate up to that 80% mark.

**3) Don't Over-Complicate Things -** I have seen some setups where people have tons of indicators on their charts, lines are everywhere, clouds and Fibs, and then underneath is a constant stream of lines crossing each other all over the damn place.  Keep it clean.  I have SMA 50,100,200 and VWAP.  I look at the True Strength Index and Relative Strength vs SPY.  If I am scalping I will put the 3/8 EMA's up for the 1 Min charts.  Technical Analysis is great, but with enough indicators you can convince yourself of anything, ""There is an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern on the 4 hour chart, with the RSI saying it is oversold and a MACD cross!""  You don't want to search for facts to confirm your theory, and having too many indicators lets you do just that.

**4) Momentum Trading - Fun and Dangerous -** Yeah, we all love momentum trading.  Watching a stock go from $6 to $7.50 in the span of 10 minutes.  And then you wait for your pullback, jump in around $7.10, and proceed to watch it drop all the way back down to $6 because nobody ever wants to exit a momentum trade.  You always think the next burst is one candle away.   You know what does work?  Around 90 minutes into trading today I notice that AAPL $129.24 after it already jumped up on the open.  I also notice that SPY was dropping and AAPL wasn't.  I went long AAPL at this point and stayed long, all the way to $130.30 which happened right before close.  Was it as exciting as watching GRAY go from $6.50 to $8.50 after-hours last week? No.  But I will take the AAPL trade every time. Because the AAPL trade will pay off almost every time.

**5) Trading Doesn't Stop When The Market Closes -** You should be looking through your trades for the day, analyzing what went wrong and what went right.  Looking at the chart and putting alert lines on various stocks you are watching for tomorrow.  Creating watchlists and doing overall market analysis.  Day Trading is a full-time job.  

**6) Stop Rushing Into Trades -** Yes, I know it is Day Trading and you don't want to miss the move.  But you need to take a breath.  Look at the charts, where is support? where is resistance? Are there a lot of bag holders right above this price? How does the daily chart look? Is the relative volume over 1.5? Is it strong/weak against the market?  What is your best play, stock? options? a spread?  Yeah, it takes time to do this, and with experience it will take less time, but you can't simply say - SRNE is moving I am going long and then jump in.  Know what price you want to get it at, and what price your target is, then rely on the charts to get you to your goal.

**7) Careful Following Trades -** When you follow someone else into a trade without knowing what their strategy is you may find yourself stuck well after they have already exited.  People tend to post their trades pretty quickly, but generally post their exits well after the fact.  If you are relying on someone else for your trades, make sure you have your own exit strategy.

Seven tips seems like enough for a Monday. 

Keep in mind, everything I tell you and post is geared towards one thing - becoming a consistently profitable Day Trader.  That is the goal.  There are no shortcuts to it, no version of it where you trade for the first hour and then go about your day (yes, there are people who do that, even some that do it successfully, but the odds are stacked against you if that is your plan).  This is about knowing you will have between $X and $X dollars of profit at the end of every month that you can pay yourself as a salary.  And that years from now, you will still have that.  

I plan on posting about Day Trading Options next.  As always, happy to answer any questions.  I also want to thank everyone for their messages and questions, I try to get to them all, it just takes some time.

I was inspired by the [WWE post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvcyxf/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cooking/) in here last week, so I thought fuck it lets use his patented S.M.E.L.L system to sniff out WWE junior. For those of you who missed out on the sweet tendies from WWE last week here’s your chance to redeem yourself. Vizio is no GME or AMC, but as long as I’m getting 1000% gains mainlined to my mommy’s basement I don’t give a fuck. 

# I: Fundamentals

I know 97% of you retards don’t about fundamentals let alone even know how to spell fundamental, but for the 3% that can tie your own shoes here’s some highlights from their Q1 [results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210511006163/en/VIZIO-HOLDING-CORP.-Reports-Q1-2021-Financial-Results): 

&#x200B;

* Net revenue increased 52% year over year to $505.7 million for Q1
* Platform+ net revenue increased 120% year over year to $52.2 million
* Gross profit increased 82% year over year to $86.7 million
* Adjusted EBITDA increased 218% year over year to $40.4 million
* SmartCast Active Accounta grew 57% year over year to 13.4 million
* SmartCast Hours grew 70% year over year to 3.6 billion
* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increased 76% year over year to $14.52

And here’s the part that gets me the most excited, Gross Profit from Platform is up 152% year over year. Vizio is already ranked #2 in best selling TV brand and #1 in best selling soundbars, and now they’re going to start competing in the smart TV market. The king of the smart TV Market right now is Roku, controlling a [30% market share as of Q1 2021](https://9to5google.com/2021/05/03/roku-global-streaming-marketshare-drops/#:~:text=Conviva%20reports%20(via%20Protocol)%20that,to%2030%25%20in%20Q1%202021.). The King is hurt right now, reeling from their awkward breakup with [Youtube TV](https://clark.com/streaming-tv/roku-announces-youtube-tv-breakup/). Turns out Youtube TV actually prefers Vizio’s [magnum dong](https://www.engadget.com/vizio-smart-cast-owners-no-longer-need-two-apps-for-you-tube-132131066.html#:~:text=Just%20here%20to%20drop%20a,in%20the%20next%20few%20days.). I’m willing to bet Vizio becomes a major player in the streaming market, plus they have the advantage of already being a huge TV manufacturer. Roku certainly got a head start, but we’ve seen companies blow a 3-1 lead before \*cough\* Skype. We all know streaming is the future, and the future of Vizio’s Smartcast (and by extension our tendies) right now is bright. And I’m not the only one who thinks this, As of 6/11/2021 Vizio has 7 Buy ratings and a consensus price target of $30.29. For the mathematically challenged that’s a *33.6%* upside from where the stock is now. Or put simply to any boomers skulking around, that’s 3.36 years of returns compared to your boomer index S&P fund, and I’m being fucking generous. 

# II. Catalysts

Vizio is getting into the data tracking/advertisement business as well, recently reporting that they have just surpassed [11 million addressable enabled TVs](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005230/en/VIZIO-Surpasses-11-Million-Addressable-Enabled-TVs) in the US. Why does this matter? It's yet another income stream for the TV manufacturing god, and one that has been insanely profitable for other companies. For those of you who live under a rock, almost all of these tech companies are competing for your data to sell to advertisers, and Vizio is finally getting into the game. We're only a few years away from lightspeed briefs ads being beamed into your dreams while you sleep, so for Vizio to start carving out a market share in this space I think is pretty significant. 

# III: Technicals

Here’s why I think VZIO can be a WWE junior.

**Extremely low float:** The float on this is around 18 million shares, which is less than half of the float on WWE. And for you AMC and GME retards, Vizio’s float is only 4% of AMC’s and less than half of GME’s. If you’re still confused let me say it this way. If everyone subscribed to wallstreetbets wanted 2 shares there wouldn’t be enough shares to go around. I’ve been sniffing around and this is the lowest float non-bullshit stocks I’ve been able to find. And by non-bullshit I mean Vizio actually has a respectable market cap and actually makes money. 

**Volume is low:** Volume is extremely low and trending lower. Average volume is only around 400k and has been trending downward ever since the IPO. 

**Options are cheap:** IV on this stock is only 54%. For reference, when CLNE popped the IV was around 80%. If there is any kind of volume spike this IV will go up considerably. It is crazy to me that the IV can be this low when the consensus price target has a 33% upside. 

**Moderate SI:** The SI is only moderate sitting at 7%, but still enough to cause some heartburn. And fuck it, it’s you know what season. With the IV so low if the shorts were forced to cover we could see some serious tendies. 

**Huge Omega:** With the IV so low it won’t take much movement for our options to print. The [Omega](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/omega.asp), or elasticity is huge. For example, when Vizio went up 3.60% last Friday June 18 2021 Calls increased 84%, or an Omega of 23.4. Plus not only is the Omega large, the options chains are fucking *scarce.* July FDs only go up to $30 strike, and if you were paying attention to the Fundamentals section that’s below their target price. 

# IV: Conclusion

This is my pick for a low-risk high reward play.  Its got everything I looked for plus the options are cheap. On the 3.6% move last Friday even my Nov 19 $25 calls went up 12%. It was fun riding the WWE tending train last week, and I think we could have a similar situation here. 

You could even play this stock like a boomer (buy and hold, can’t go tits up) and come out with some solid gains if we hit the consensus price target. I think the July 25C have a great chance of printing. I’m personally holding shares, June 18 22.5 C, July 16 25 C, and Nov 19 25 C, and if this post gains traction here I'll probably add some 25C FDs. 

Not financial advice, buy some shares and options or don’t, I don’t really give a fuck. I just like the stock and the 32"" Vizio my mommy got me for birthday so I thought I'd share this post with you degenerates. I sit in front of a computer for a living so I’m probably actually autistic.",2021-06-14

o023f9,8,32,wallstreetbets,Q&A notes from recent Q&A w/ CEO of Fubo,0.69,1623719782.0,1623719782.0,"Q&A was with the CEO of FuboTV, a leading OTT sports streaming service with +85 live channels of sports-focused programming.

* **Company fundamentals:** FUBO has 35k+ SVOD assets and 50k+ live events including the largest football package in the US (NFL & NCAA) and the highest number of regional sports networks in the US. Key drivers for growth include: 1) secular decline of traditional TV 2) shift of advertising dollars from traditional TV to connected devices 3) online wagering / betting 4) FUBO is a young company (founded 2015) compared to peers such as NFLX / ROKU (25 years old) and KPIs are growing at triple digit rates.
* **Subscriber metrics:** Total subscriber count for vMVPDs is \~11mm households vs \~73mm traditional paid TV households. Over the next 10 years the executive expects the secular decline of traditional TV will continue and for the subscriber count to drop to as few as \~25mm households. He expects vMVPDs to capture a significant amount of these traditional TV cord cutters as “subscription fatigue” sets in for SVOD and AVOD services – this will become especially prominent as monthly sub prices increase (e.g Disney+ increased $1/month in Mar’21). He anticipates 2026 (\~4-5 years from now) will be an inflection point where vMVPDs will become larger than traditional cable services. The executive highlighted that FUBO’s sub count typically declines going into Q1 but picks up significantly in Q3 & Q4 as fans become re-engaged with football season – in Q3’20, FUBO added \~165k subs, Hulu 700k, YouTube 500k, Sling 200k.
* **vMVPDs vs SVOD:** The executive identified headwinds for SVOD services which will likely limit their long-term growth, requiring them to more widely distribute content on other services including vMVPDs. These are: 1) for SVOD services (excl. NFLX), the cost associated with producing content coupled with the low hit rate of shows is too capital intensive to limit content to their own platforms 2) as the growth in SVOD sub counts slows their profits will decrease but production costs will remain the same or increase. In addition, long-term, the executive expects more simulcast on cable + vMVPDs in order for the cable companies to maximize the value of their content. The need to distribute content on vMVPDs will “spark a second wave of growth on the vMVPD side”.
* **Betting / Wagering:** The executive remains highly optimistic on FUBO’s entrance into sports betting due to:  1) FUBO has brand awareness within sports and enormous sports content – “I do not see why we could not get to 5% of the betting market” which is a $70bn market 2) Vigtory acquisition – the asset is a fully functioning sports book that FUBO has continued to build upon and improve 3) state licenses – FUBO secured 3 licenses in Q1’21 (IA, IN, NJ) and could launch in \~80% of markets by the end of 2022 if needed 4) competition – FUBO’s core vMVPD competitors are giants such as GOOGL / YouTube, DKNG and other pure betting companies are much smaller 5) upward trend in vMVPDs gaining sports betting share – vMVPDs had 2.8% of the market in 2019 → \~5.5% today. Long-term, FUBO’s betting platform will have key competitive advantages which include: 1) authenticating the video user with the betting app – FUBO will have the betslip open directly to the game being watched on TV vs opening an app and having to find the correct game 2) prop betting – FUBO has engaged users watching live games which opens up more opportunities within prop betting vs competitors (e.g. if a user loves field goals, FUBO will bring up a quad view of 4 NFL games all close to having a field goal attempted).
* **ARPU:** FUBO started at $6.99/month in 2015 → $61.00/month today. He attributes the 10x ARPU increase to: 1) strong product / platform 2) targeting customers who understand the value of FUBO’s bundle – \~40yo males 3) branding – FUBO has 10-15% more sports content than competitors 4) value-added functions such as 4k, quad view, calendar view for sporting events, etc…
* **Price inflation:** FUBO dropped churn in Q3’21 despite raising prices and continues to see q/q growth. Peers such as Sling and DIS saw lackluster sub growth in Q4 & Q1 and highlighted the headwinds they are facing were based on price increases. Long-term, the executive believes FUBO will continue to be more shielded from price inflation vs peers due to: 1) 95% of FUBO’s users are sports fans – if only 30% of consumers who have cable watch sports, a price increase due to sports programming will isolate the other 70% of the audience 2) adding wagering, which is at a 50% gross margin, will be another revenue stream to handle price inflation 3) media companies who are paying 60-100% more for broadcasting rights will pass this on to users which will shrink their audience and decreasing advertising revenue → they will need to distribute further to make up for this lost revenue so vMVPDs will benefit.

**Direct Q&A:**

* **There have been customer complaints about uneven video quality on FuboTV, can he discuss this? A:** “Because we control our own video coding and delivery, there was a point in 2019 where we were 12 or 13 seconds from the edge and there is a FCC broadcast rule which requires a delay of 9 seconds in case of emergencies. We found people cared more about the quality of the video rather than the lag. We could always change it back whenever we want but for now we still find customers continue to care more about the quality”.
* \*\*Explain the Net present value of a subscriber of a traditional cable sub vs a virtual cable sub? A: “\*\*The number of attachments sold was 1.23mm in March 2021. With 129 hours of viewership, we will continue to be able to improve our ability to sell more attachments. Right now we are at about $840 of revenue on a run rate basis and we will probably hit \~$2k long-term including wagering and any additional attachments we would be selling. It would also include commerce – we added a button on videos which leads consumers to a commerce platform if clicked so it is like a “mini Amazon ecosystem” where sports and betting are the hook.
* **Outside of soccer and possibly gambling, what exclusive content does Fubo have? A:** “I believe content should be fully distributed in order to be fully monetized. In terms of what we have today - de facto exclusive - is all NY hockey, the Knicks, all Boston local sports with the Bruins / Red Sox / Patriots / Celtics, Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Penguins and Pirates, the Houston Astros and Rockets, and Pac-12 teams”.
* **In the shorter-term, can Fubo become a greater aggregator of content where they bundle OTT streaming services and integrate them for on-demand viewing? A:** “It is certainly possible but not rational. The entertainment piece is important because it drives usage and stickiness. Sports-only is basically about PPV and the churn rate is \~35%. Even with this churn the service still showed value because these consumers signed up, had a great experience, rated 5 stars, and dropped after their team lost in the playoffs – they got what they wanted. Entertainment allows us to improve our retention because it is an expensive product so it is important to have the consumers come to our platform consistently. That is reflected in our churn numbers in which we have had 8 quarters of sequential churn decline”.
* **Most smart TVs are fairly limited in the number of buttons on the remotes, how do you approach this from a UI/UX perspective when competing against phone-based sports betting apps? A:** “As long as you have anything with a pointer and arrows you will be fine. You’ll see it on Roku in the next 5 weeks or so when we are launching our free-to-play predictive games. Apple will be different – we are not planning on launching them soon because it is a more robust platform so we will do more with it”.

o1hm5n,17,27,Daytrading,Recap of today's trading - 6/16,0.88,1623883121.0,1623883121.0,"Lots of you have asked me to do a recap of my trading for the day, so here you go!

Much better trading day then the pure torture of yesterday's low volume crawl that was like waiting at the DMV and never getting your number called.

I started out going long CNC at 73.35 at around 9:55am (I will put all times in EST, even though I am on the west coast) and quickly sold it ten minutes later for a $1 gain.  CNC breached an alert line I had set for it awhile back.

DDOG caught my eye around 10am with such a strong open and a great looking daily chart. DDOG is through all of its SMA's and breached horizontal resistance.  I went long at 99.23 at 10am.   I stayed with DDOG even as it fell to 96.29 because it remained above the 8EMA and all major technical support areas on the daily chart (this is why it is so important to take stocks that have good daily charts).  DDOG closed the day at 98.38, I am currently holding it down .91 cents a share and not at all concerned.  This trade will be fine.

I made my only mistake of the day going long ROKU at 345.06 at 10:18, it was through the SMA 50 and had Relative Strength. The mistake wasn't entering the trade, it was not exiting when it went below the SMA 50 and I didn't sell it.  I am holding ROKU right now at an average cost of 398.70.  Remarkably stupid decision on my part - not only did I not get out of the trade, but I also averaged down.

At 11:01am I went long ZI at 48.40 and sold it at 11:24am at 48.95 for a .55 gain.  ZI went through its SMA 100 with ease and even with SPY remaining stable it continued to move up showing Relative Strength to the market.

11:45am I went long ENPH at 152.15.  I saw that there was horizontal resistance on ENPH around 153.30, so I put in an offer right below that for 153.15.  SPY began dropping in anticipation of the FED, but ENPH consolidated, telling me to stay in the trade.  I liked the daily chart with the breakout to the upside of its' compression and was prepared to hold the stock overnight if needed.  Turned out I didn't need to as at 12:54pm it sold for a $1 gain. 

At 11:50am I shorted TTWO at 172.68 and bought it back at 2:10pm at 169.55 for a $3.13 gain.  TTWO has one of the uglier daily charts you will see, breaking out of consolidation to the downside and crashing right through its' SMA's as if they weren't there.  On the 5 minute chart, even as SPY was climbing in the morning, TTWO was continuing its' decline.  This trade was a no-brainer and worked out quite well.

At this point I started watching WISH as it kept banging up against VWAP.  On its fourth attempt I put in a buy order for 10.85 and moved on to the next trade.

At 12:31pm I shorted TAL at 24.60.  Remember when I said TTWO had an ugly daily chart? Well TAL's may just be worse.  Around 2 hours later I bought it back at 23.68 for a .92 gain.  TAL has been one of the weaker stocks this past week, and when combined with Relative Weakness, this was also an easy trade to take.  My mistake here was that I should have taken it sooner.  TAL was on my list for shorts and for some reason I did not check the chart until around 3 hours into trading.

At 1:17pm I went long ELAN at 36.15 as I liked the daily chart and the Relative Strength on the 5 minute basis. ELAN then proceed to do absolutely nothing for the next two hours and I scratched the trade for breakeven.

Three minutes later I went long ZM at 362.01, also liking the breakout to the upside on the compression for the daily chart which formed the beginnings of a bull flag, the next resistance point being over $20 away, and the breach of the horizontal resistance yesterday.  Then I watched as ZM dropped, and dropped, and dropped, all the way down to 355.41 (thanks Fed!).  I averaged down for the second time today, bringing my price to 359.40.  Why did I average down? Because my brain was set on ""idiot"" this morning.  Still holding ZM was the right play as no technical indicators were breached.  At 3:30pm, I sold ZM for 361.80, which was a 2.40 gain.  This turned into a nice trade for me even though I was a moron for averaging down.

Thanks to the FED announcement I took BK long at 51.30 and decided to hold it overnight.  There is a textbook bull flag on today's five minute chart, and the stock held all the gains from that parabolic move at 2pm.

Around 2:25 I added to VXX calls to hedge against the FED press conference.  I took the 6/25 30 strike calls for 2.70 each and the sold them 20 minutes later for 3.15, a gain of .45 per contract.

At this time I also watched my fellow traders go in on EYES and for some reason I did not.  Why? Because my brain was set to ""idiot"" remember?

3pm is when WISH order went through at 10.85.  This was purely a volume breakthrough of VWAP play.  WISH was dancing around VWAP for most of the day and I knew if it got enough volume behind it that the stock would go - which it did.  Literally just sold WISH right as I am writing this recap, in After Hours for 11.20, a 35 cent gain.  Resistance is at 11.35 and I will look tomorrow to see if it breaks through.

Throughout the day I scalped various stocks which are not worth mentioning here.  Overall an excellent day, I am holding a few stocks overnight (DDOG, BK, ROKU) and now I am making my watchlist for tomorrow.",2021-06-16

*Comments that try to disparage Day Trading in general will also be ignored, as this is a Day Trading sub, if you don't think it is possible to be successful Day Trading than your only reason for being here is to antagonize people.*

*As always, I will engage in substantive disagreement or criticism, as those discussions are part of what make forums like this worthwhile.*

So....Options.  I am going to assume that people here have a general understanding of what Options are, including the Greeks (*if not than this post will be of limited use to you as you* ***should not*** *be trading options unless you understand them).*  Thus, if the extent of your understanding is, ""Use a Call when you think it is going up and a Put when you think it will go down..."" you should probably skip the rest of this and learn the mechanics of Option Trading first.

While Options have many purposes, the ***primary purpose of using Options to Day Trade is - leverage.***  Otherwise you would simply use the stock directly which is far easier, and tends not to be subject to issues in liquidity.

Given this, the closer to parity with the underlying that you get on option pricing, the better (if you are buying options rather than selling them) -  ideally a stock worth $120 would have $100 Calls worth $20.  But since you are paying for time and volatility as well (not going to get into *Rho* here), you are getting charged a premium.

Also, as a general rule, I do not hold Options over an earnings date.  Many people buy Calls or Puts on a stock right before earnings, and even when they get the move they were expecting their options did not increase in value - usually due to an **IV Crush**.  Option pricing is higher before earnings because there is more volatility around the predicted future range of pricing for that stock.  If you add the price of the ATM Calls + Puts together you will get a rough idea of the +/- expected $ move post-earnings.  The larger that move is in proportion to the stock price, the higher the volatility.  Once those earnings are released, that volatility deflates, taking down the Option premium with it.    Earnings and the stocks response to earnings is simply too unpredictable, and also well outside the purview of Day Trading (as these occur pre or post-market).

This is how I Day Trade Options, it isn't the only way, it may not even be the *best* way, but it has worked for me - as always you need to explore what works best for yourself:

**1) High Delta - 1-3 WTE :**  I have a decent account balance but not 5,000 shares of NVDA ""decent"" and certainly not 5,000 shares of AMZN level.  So it is on stocks like these (usually priced over $500) that I will use to Options to Day Trade.  However, my NVDA may be your AAPL - so essentially, I am using Options when I cannot afford to get enough shares of the stock to make the trade worth it.  The temptation here is to go for the cheaper options which are going to be OTM or ATM - but I recommend against this.  The underlying position has to make a larger move to get those options close enough to parity to start overcoming what you paid in premium.  In the end your Risk/Reward is much better on the ITM options.

*For example:  You want to go long AAPL using Options - You can either use the 2 weeks out options with a Delta of .8 or the ATM options that expire this week.*

***Choice 1 - On Monday 6/21 you buy 5 123 Strike Calls on AAPL that expire 7/09 for $8.15 each, costing you $4,075.  Assuming the stock is at $130.46, you are paying .69 cent extra (123+8.15= $131.15-$130.46 = .69) in premium ($345). The Delta is .8 and Gamma is .03.***

*Scenario A - The stock goes up $1.50 on Monday.  At the end of the day your option would now be worth (not using an Option Calculator so this is a rough estimate) - + $1.20 (Delta) + .015 (Gamma) - .01 (Theta) = $9.36 (roughly).  You made about $1.21 per contract, or roughly $605.*

*Scenario B - The stock stays the same - since the Theta on these options is only .06 you can hold them overnight with minimal loss ($30 total).*

*Scenario C - The stock declined $1.50 - as the stock declines you have room on the Delta to weather the decrease.  With the stock now at $128.96, your options would be worth roughly $6.85 (although a decline like this would most like increase volatility, further cushioning the drop) a loss of $1.30 per option, which is roughly $650 total.  However, you can still hold this option if you believe AAPL will recover enough in the next 2-3 weeks.*

***Choice 2 - On Monday 6/21 you buy ATM (130 strike) options on AAPL for $1.80.  Because they are cheaper, you get 23 of them for $4,140 (roughly the same cost as 5 options in Choice 1).  Assuming the stock is at $130.46 you are paying an extra $1.34 (130+1.80 = 131.80-130.46 = $1.34) in premium ($3,082).***

*Scenario A - The stock goes up $1.50 on Monday.  At the end of the day your option would now be worth (not using an Option Calculator so this is a rough estimate) - + .78 (Delta) + .04 (Gamma) - .09 (Theta) = $2.53 (roughly).  You made about $.73 per contract, or roughly $1,679.*

*Scenario B - The stock stays the same - since the Theta on these options is .15 it now cost you $330 (roughly) to hold these overnight in additional time decay.*

*Scenario C - The stock declined $1.50 - and you are now screwed.  Your options are worth about .75 cents each, you've lost roughly $2,415 on them, and if you hold them overnight they will continue to decline rapidly with time decay kicking in faster.*

Compare the Risk/Reward on both of these choices (*Choice 1 - $650/$605, Choice 2 - $2,415/1679)* \- and while these are rough guesses they aren't too far off from what would happen (a good Option Calculator can help here).

**Choice 1 is better.**

*Less contracts - Higher Delta - More Time to Expiration.*

*Naturally this applies to Puts as well.*

You are looking for the following attributes in the stock you are want to Day Trade with Options:

*Strong Intra-Day Chart -* Ideally you want a stock that is strong vs the market (SPY) or weak vs the market (SPY), depending on if you are doing calls or puts.  The stock should be through any significant support/resistance (e.g. you do not want to do calls on a stock that is at 119.75 if their SMA 100 on the daily chart is at 120, you need to see it go through that and hold, first).  Relative volume usually needs to be above 1.5, and you should using VWAP to guide you as well.

*Strong Daily Chart -* Obviously the Daily chart will be important in telling you where significant support/resistance lies, but you also want to see an overall strong directional trend (bullish or bearish depending on your desired position).  I like to see HA candles in a continuation (e.g. flat bottomed) at least two in a row, and orderly trends without parabolic moves.  If you choose the right options and the stock hasn't violated any major areas of S/R, you can hold them overnight.

Your exit should be similar to the exit you would have used if you were trading the stock - the same principles apply.

**2**\*\*\*)\*\*\* **Selling Premium -** This is rarely used a Day Trading method and for good reason, you are usually not going to get much bang for the margin you are spending if you only plan to flip them within the same day.  As a general rule I only sell Puts on a stock I wouldn't mind owning at that price.  If I get assigned, I am perfectly happy with it, and if I keep the credit, I am also happy with that.  Overall, I  would not recommend this strategy for Day Trading as you are removing the primary benefit of selling premium - *theta decay.*

**3) Debit Spreads -** Call Debit Spreads(CDS') are an acceptable and widely used method to Day Trade Options, particularly among those that are risk adverse.  Here are some simple rules to follow that will help increase your odds:

*A) Find stocks that are making significant moves on that day - note, I am not talking about low float cheap morning gappers - rather I am referring to stocks like ROKU, ZM, ABNB or stocks like SNAP or NIO (these stocks are examples as they are capable of making and sustaining big daily moves, but their are many like these).  Basically you want a stock that is up more than 3-5% and holding those gains after an hour into trading.  They should be strong against the market, meaning if the market (SPY) is going down, this stock is staying strong either still going up or compressing.  There is usually at least one stock a day that qualifies, sometimes two or three.  Volume will of course taper off, but you do want to see Relative Volume over 1.5.*

*B) You are looking for the ATM Options to do the CDS' and they expire* ***this*** *week - so on Friday a stock like ROKU would have been perfect.  Around 10:25 SPY started to drop and ROKU continued to build on already strong gains.  In this case you would want something like the 360/365 or 360/362.5 spread.  You* ***never*** *want to pay more than 50% of the distance between the strikes.  If you were doing the 360/365 Spread, you want to pay less than $2.50 for that spread - obviously, the lower the better.*

*C) The moment you put the spread in, you put in your order to receive your credit.  The day of the week matters here - On a Monday put in an order to get 10% profit, Tuesday would 15% profit, Wednesday - 20-25% profit, Thursday - 25%-40% profit, and Friday - 40% - 75% profit.  Rarely do I keep these until expiration unless the stock just blows through the strikes.  The reason the day matters is that these spreads only start to really move when you are close to expiration, it is difficult to get more than these percentages on those days.  If you took that ROKU spread on a Monday (360/365) and paid a $2.00 debit, you should look to get a $2.20 credit, but on Friday (since it is expiring that day) you could have gotten at least a $3.00 credit.*

I see traders that do this type of spread as their primary trade type, and by the end of the week they would have executed roughly 20-25 of them, with over a 95% win rate.  These are usually very safe spreads, but of course with low risk also comes low returns; however, they are consistent.  The stock doesn't have to make much more of an upward move to hit your target, and considering how strong they were to begin with it is very rare to miss with these.  Obviously there is always a stock like NVDA which on Friday if you did a 765/770 spread in the morning, it would have made perfect sense, but quickly reversed.  In those cases you should recognize the reversal and take the loss (e.g. if you paid $2.00 for NVDA, you should accept a $1.50 credit,  do not let the stock drop to where the credit is lower than that, just take the  loss).

**4) Lotto Trades**  \- These are the most fun, and are specific to Friday.  What you are looking for are stocks that have options expiring that day.  In the final hour of trading, the ATM options are going to be very close to parity.  So a stock that is $119.80 cents, will have $120 call options worth roughly .05-.10 cents with an hour left.  What you are looking for are stocks that are either relatively strong (or weak if you are doing this with Puts) to the market and a market tailwind (in the direction of your options).  You are looking for these options to get into the money, but even if they don't you can still do quite well with them.  On Friday for example, back to NVDA, it began dropping and the 750 Puts were worth roughly .20 cents with 25 minutes remaining and NVDA at around 755.  The stock was weak compared to the market (on the 5 minute chart when SPY went up, NVDA went down), and SPY began to drop with volume (tailwind).  If you bought 25 of those Puts ($500), within 10 minutes they would have been worth $3.60 an 1,800% increase.  Your $500 would now be worth $9000.    You won't find a better Risk/Reward play than lotto options.  However, note, you shouldn't be making large financial plays here as a many of these won't work, but the ones that do more than pay for the ones that did not.  Many times I take max loss on these; however, since these can turn very quickly, I have also taken that smaller loss only to see the stock soar or plummet in those final ten minutes.  Either way, these are really fun (I have a more detailed post on this).

So there you have it, like I said, there are many other ways to Day Trade Options (would like to hear them), but this is how I like to do it and it has worked well for me over the years.",2021-06-18

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY and QQQ gapping up pre-market. Nice recovery from SPY's gap down Friday which I suspected was an overreaction to the FED meeting last week.  Yesterday Tech was the leading sector and Retail along With Gambling, Solar and Coal were the leading industries. As usual in summer we are seeing some nice moves in small caps. Since there are very few earnings being released it is important to pay attention to volume in the stocks you are trading. Manage risk and use stops. It is best to take the loss and re-enter than to hold onto baggage. Bag holding is an excuse for a lack of knowledge pertaining to timing when entering trades. If I enter and the trade reaches my stop, I timed the trade wrong or I am trying to trade the wrong direction. I take a small loss and re-enter the trade at the correct time or in the correct direction or I choose not to trade it again. Manage risk and you will succeed in this game. Good luck out there.

Here is the plan I set for reaching my primary target i.e. getting my account value over $25k and switching to a non- PDT restricted margin account from my current cash account by the end of summer: [The Excel formula I'm using to set my daily profit target each week = ROUNDDOWN\(\(\[@\[Starting Balance\]\]\*0.035\)\/50, 0\)\*50](https://preview.redd.it/0lscqnct53771.jpg?width=1406&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a95b9d7e690c0b3e0e6aa57e7a92813522d2094)

I am still struggling to benefit off of my scalping strategy at the beginning of the week.

I have figured out that Moday and Tuesday are better for trend following trades, but those don't really suit my personality.

P.S. ROKU caught my attention today. I scalped a call and a put on it around 3 pm ET today with the last $350 or so I was left with. I think I will be paying more attention on this name tomorrow.

The market edged higher once again, with both the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) driven higher by an incredible rally in technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA), which suffered its worst performance since October 2020 last week continued to recover, pushed higher by a rally in bank and industrial stocks. “Reopening stocks” like cruise lines, hotels, and airlines continue to underperform the market, pressured by the rotation back to growth and concerns that inflation will drive prices in this sector higher. 

After driving the market higher in the beginning of the year, the last two or so months have seen the market firmly rotate from value and cyclical stocks back to growth and technology stocks due to recent inflationary numbers and labor market disruption that threaten to drive prices for services in this sector higher. However, as I have said previously, while I acknowledge the risk, I am not yet concerned that current inflation will become a persistent threat, at least in the near-term. While that may change and I advise people to be ready in case the Fed is forced to tighten rates sooner-than-expected, I expect value and cyclicals to continue recovering as the US economy continues to reopen. With the stock market’s great performance in the last 12-14 months and government coronavirus stimulus, I expect savings-laden consumers to spend big this summer after being cooped up indoors for so long. 

Keith Lerner, Portfolio and Market Strategist at Truist Securities said, “The value trade is still intact. It got overcrowded, it got over-loved ... but when we look at the fundamental drivers behind that trade, they're still intact. So the first thing is, context. Yes, they had a big run this year, but they've trailed for about 14 years, so we've had a long underperformance cycle,"" he added. ""And the second part is, why did they underperform for so long is because we had really slow economic growth. And this year and next we expect above-trend economic growth. And the earnings momentum and the earnings leverage for these areas is still positive."" 

Later today, the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. **If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge if it happens.** 

On Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board

**Highlights**

* **As I was finishing the recap the news is out, the Fed is ending pandemic-era restriction on banks in stock buybacks and dividend increases. This is great news for banks.** More information here [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html)
* After being under pressure in recent months, shares of Tesla (TSLA) have begun rallying again, with the stock up more than 10% this week alone. 
* Today, Microsoft will unveil the long-awaited sequel to Windows 10. Windows 11, the product's first new version in almost six years, includes only limited changes to its visual design, but it seeks to reposition the operating system as a hub in a computing universe incorporating rival companies' platforms, including Android mobile software developed by Google and a digital storefront developed by Amazon (AMZN).[ Read more here ](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsofts-windows-11-reveal-event-every-upgrade-announced/)
* The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to approve the final piece of its six-part package, the ""Ending Platform Monopolies Act,"" which restricts big tech companies' ability to leverage their platform dominance to promote other lines of business and disadvantage competitors. The vote on the bill was 21-20. The bill will now move on to the House floor and, if passed there, the Senate. The bill is newsworthy but pretty much doomed to fail.
* Snapchat (SNAP) users globally will get access to Universal Music Group's library of recorded music and content for their own content-making on the social media platform, the companies said Thursday. This move comes as US social media companies across the board continue to implement more “TikTok-like” features. To show just how much TikTok has grown, parent company ByteDancehas a market cap of roughly $250 billion, almost $100 billion more than Snap and Twitter (TWTR) combined.

“Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet.” - Aristotle",2021-06-24
o6qpwc,13,86,options,Day Trading Options,0.9,1624498286.0,1624498286.0,"I posted a version of this in the Day Trading sub, but since it deals solely with options it seemed appropriate to put it here as well (as I imagine their are some Day Traders in this forum as well).

As a note, my preference is to Day Trade stocks, I believe they are better suited for round-trip trades.  On stocks like TSLA (which is currently in a very bullish pattern <as of 6/23/2021> and ITM calls 2-3 weeks out would not be a bad play), or NVDA (Call Debit Spreads are good on this stock - I am currently riding a 750/760 CDS that I got yesterday for a $4 debit and plan to sell in the morning for a $7.50 credit) it makes sense to me to Day Trade options.  However, for stocks in the range of DBX or AMAT or even MSFT I recommend Day Trading the stocks.  *This is my personal preference and know many traders that do quite well Day Trading Options.*

I went back and forth on how to write a post on Day Trading Options. One can get very granular on this topic but ultimately it seemed to me that what most people wanted was a general guide.

*It was pointed out to me that I spend way too much time replying to people who post disruptive/antagonistic comments. I agree. So moving forward I will be ignoring comments that are posted solely for the purpose of being argumentative. If you question my qualifications or intentions, both of those have been addressed numerous times and you can check my profile. I have been a Day Trader for five years, consistently profitable for the last three years, and I do this for a living. I have nothing to sell, nor do I benefit from anything I recommend in terms of resources.*

*As always, I will engage in substantive disagreement or criticism, as those discussions are part of what make forums like this worthwhile.*

So....Options. I am going to assume that people here have a general understanding of what Options are, including the Greeks (*if not than this post will be of limited use to you as you* ***should not*** *be trading options unless you understand them).* Thus, if the extent of your understanding is, ""Use a Call when you think it is going up and a Put when you think it will go down..."" you should probably skip the rest of this and learn the mechanics of Option Trading first.

While Options have many purposes, the ***primary purpose of using Options to Day Trade is - leverage.*** Otherwise you would simply use the stock directly which is far easier, and tends not to be subject to issues in liquidity.

Given this, the closer to parity with the underlying that you get on option pricing, the better (if you are buying options rather than selling them) - ideally a stock worth $120 would have $100 Calls worth $20. But since you are paying for time and volatility as well (not going to get into *Rho* here), you are getting charged a premium.

Also, as a general rule, I do not hold Options over an earnings date. Many people buy Calls or Puts on a stock right before earnings, and even when they get the move they were expecting their options did not increase in value - usually due to an **IV Crush**. Option pricing is higher before earnings because there is more volatility around the predicted future range of pricing for that stock. If you add the price of the ATM Calls + Puts together you will get a rough idea of the +/- expected $ move post-earnings. The larger that move is in proportion to the stock price, the higher the volatility. Once those earnings are released, that volatility deflates, taking down the Option premium with it. Earnings and the stocks response to earnings is simply too unpredictable, and also well outside the purview of Day Trading (as these occur pre or post-market).

This is how I Day Trade Options, it isn't the only way, it may not even be the *best* way, but it has worked for me - as always you need to explore what works best for yourself:

**1) High Delta - 1-3 WTE :** I have a decent account balance but not 5,000 shares of NVDA ""decent"" and certainly not 5,000 shares of AMZN level. So it is on stocks like these (usually priced over $500) that I will use to Options to Day Trade. However, my NVDA may be your AAPL - so essentially, I am using Options when I cannot afford to get enough shares of the stock to make the trade worth it. The temptation here is to go for the cheaper options which are going to be OTM or ATM - but I recommend against this. The underlying position has to make a larger move to get those options close enough to parity to start overcoming what you paid in premium. In the end your Risk/Reward is much better on the ITM options.

*For example: You want to go long AAPL using Options - You can either use the 2 weeks out options with a Delta of .8 or the ATM options that expire this week.*

***Choice 1 - On Monday 6/21 you buy 5 123 Strike Calls on AAPL that expire 7/09 for $8.15 each, costing you $4,075. Assuming the stock is at $130.46, you are paying .69 cent extra (123+8.15= $131.15-$130.46 = .69) in premium ($345). The Delta is .8 and Gamma is .03.***

*Scenario A - The stock goes up $1.50 on Monday. At the end of the day your option would now be worth (not using an Option Calculator so this is a rough estimate) - + $1.20 (Delta) + .015 (Gamma) - .01 (Theta) = $9.36 (roughly). You made about $1.21 per contract, or roughly $605.*

*Scenario B - The stock stays the same - since the Theta on these options is only .06 you can hold them overnight with minimal loss ($30 total).*

*Scenario C - The stock declined $1.50 - as the stock declines you have room on the Delta to weather the decrease. With the stock now at $128.96, your options would be worth roughly $6.85 (although a decline like this would most like increase volatility, further cushioning the drop) a loss of $1.30 per option, which is roughly $650 total. However, you can still hold this option if you believe AAPL will recover enough in the next 2-3 weeks.*

***Choice 2 - On Monday 6/21 you buy ATM (130 strike) options on AAPL for $1.80. Because they are cheaper, you get 23 of them for $4,140 (roughly the same cost as 5 options in Choice 1). Assuming the stock is at $130.46 you are paying an extra $1.34 (130+1.80 = 131.80-130.46 = $1.34) in premium ($3,082).***

*Scenario A - The stock goes up $1.50 on Monday. At the end of the day your option would now be worth (not using an Option Calculator so this is a rough estimate) - + .78 (Delta) + .04 (Gamma) - .09 (Theta) = $2.53 (roughly). You made about $.73 per contract, or roughly $1,679.*

*Scenario B - The stock stays the same - since the Theta on these options is .15 it now cost you $330 (roughly) to hold these overnight in additional time decay.*

*Scenario C - The stock declined $1.50 - and you are now screwed. Your options are worth about .75 cents each, you've lost roughly $2,415 on them, and if you hold them overnight they will continue to decline rapidly with time decay kicking in faster.*

Compare the Risk/Reward on both of these choices (*Choice 1 - $650/$605, Choice 2 - $2,415/1679)* \- and while these are rough guesses they aren't too far off from what would happen (a good Option Calculator can help here).

**Choice 1 is better.**

*Less contracts - Higher Delta - More Time to Expiration.*

*Naturally this applies to Puts as well.*

You are looking for the following attributes in the stock you are want to Day Trade with Options:

*Strong Intra-Day Chart -* Ideally you want a stock that is strong vs the market (SPY) or weak vs the market (SPY), depending on if you are doing calls or puts. The stock should be through any significant support/resistance (e.g. you do not want to do calls on a stock that is at 119.75 if their SMA 100 on the daily chart is at 120, you need to see it go through that and hold, first). Relative volume usually needs to be above 1.5, and you should using VWAP to guide you as well.

*Strong Daily Chart -* Obviously the Daily chart will be important in telling you where significant support/resistance lies, but you also want to see an overall strong directional trend (bullish or bearish depending on your desired position). I like to see HA candles in a continuation (e.g. flat bottomed) at least two in a row, and orderly trends without parabolic moves. If you choose the right options and the stock hasn't violated any major areas of S/R, you can hold them overnight.

Your exit should be similar to the exit you would have used if you were trading the stock - the same principles apply.

**2**\*\*\*)\*\*\* **Selling Premium -** This is rarely used a Day Trading method and for good reason, you are usually not going to get much bang for the margin you are spending if you only plan to flip them within the same day. As a general rule I only sell Puts on a stock I wouldn't mind owning at that price. If I get assigned, I am perfectly happy with it, and if I keep the credit, I am also happy with that. Overall, I would not recommend this strategy for Day Trading as you are removing the primary benefit of selling premium - *theta decay.*

**3) Debit Spreads -** Call Debit Spreads(CDS') are an acceptable and widely used method to Day Trade Options, particularly among those that are risk adverse. Here are some simple rules to follow that will help increase your odds:

*A) Find stocks that are making significant moves on that day - note, I am not talking about low float cheap morning gappers - rather I am referring to stocks like ROKU, ZM, ABNB or stocks like SNAP or NIO (these stocks are examples as they are capable of making and sustaining big daily moves, but their are many like these). Basically you want a stock that is up more than 3-5% and holding those gains after an hour into trading. They should be strong against the market, meaning if the market (SPY) is going down, this stock is staying strong either still going up or compressing. There is usually at least one stock a day that qualifies, sometimes two or three. Volume will of course taper off, but you do want to see Relative Volume over 1.5.*

*B) You are looking for the ATM Options to do the CDS' and they expire* ***this*** *week - so on Friday a stock like ROKU would have been perfect. Around 10:25 SPY started to drop and ROKU continued to build on already strong gains. In this case you would want something like the 360/365 or 360/362.5 spread. You* ***never*** *want to pay more than 50% of the distance between the strikes. If you were doing the 360/365 Spread, you want to pay less than $2.50 for that spread - obviously, the lower the better.*

*C) The moment you put the spread in, you put in your order to receive your credit. The day of the week matters here - On a Monday put in an order to get 10% profit, Tuesday would 15% profit, Wednesday - 20-25% profit, Thursday - 25%-40% profit, and Friday - 40% - 75% profit. Rarely do I keep these until expiration unless the stock just blows through the strikes. The reason the day matters is that these spreads only start to really move when you are close to expiration, it is difficult to get more than these percentages on those days. If you took that ROKU spread on a Monday (360/365) and paid a $2.00 debit, you should look to get a $2.20 credit, but on Friday (since it is expiring that day) you could have gotten at least a $3.00 credit.*

I see traders that do this type of spread as their primary trade type, and by the end of the week they would have executed roughly 20-25 of them, with over a 95% win rate. These are usually very safe spreads, but of course with low risk also comes low returns; however, they are consistent. The stock doesn't have to make much more of an upward move to hit your target, and considering how strong they were to begin with it is very rare to miss with these. Obviously there is always a stock like NVDA which on Friday if you did a 765/770 spread in the morning, it would have made perfect sense, but quickly reversed. In those cases you should recognize the reversal and take the loss (e.g. if you paid $2.00 for NVDA, you should accept a $1.50 credit, do not let the stock drop to where the credit is lower than that, just take the loss).

**4) Lotto Trades** \- These are the most fun, and are specific to Friday. What you are looking for are stocks that have options expiring that day. In the final hour of trading, the ATM options are going to be very close to parity. So a stock that is $119.80 cents, will have $120 call options worth roughly .05-.10 cents with an hour left. What you are looking for are stocks that are either relatively strong (or weak if you are doing this with Puts) to the market and a market tailwind (in the direction of your options). You are looking for these options to get into the money, but even if they don't you can still do quite well with them. On Friday for example, back to NVDA, it began dropping and the 750 Puts were worth roughly .20 cents with 25 minutes remaining and NVDA at around 755. The stock was weak compared to the market (on the 5 minute chart when SPY went up, NVDA went down), and SPY began to drop with volume (tailwind). If you bought 25 of those Puts ($500), within 10 minutes they would have been worth $3.60 an 1,800% increase. Your $500 would now be worth $9000. You won't find a better Risk/Reward play than lotto options. However, note, you shouldn't be making large financial plays here as a many of these won't work, but the ones that do more than pay for the ones that did not. Many times I take max loss on these; however, since these can turn very quickly, I have also taken that smaller loss only to see the stock soar or plummet in those final ten minutes. Either way, these are really fun (I have a more detailed post on this).

So there you have it, like I said, there are many other ways to Day Trade Options (would like to hear how you prefer to trade them), but this is what has worked well for me over the years.",2021-06-24

The market edged higher once again, with both the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) driven higher by an incredible rally in technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA), which suffered its worst performance since October 2020 last week continued to recover, pushed higher by a rally in bank and industrial stocks. “Reopening stocks” like cruise lines, hotels, and airlines continue to underperform the market, pressured by the rotation back to growth and concerns that inflation will drive prices in this sector higher. 

After driving the market higher in the beginning of the year, the last two or so months have seen the market firmly rotate from value and cyclical stocks back to growth and technology stocks due to recent inflationary numbers and labor market disruption that threaten to drive prices for services in this sector higher. However, as I have said previously, while I acknowledge the risk, I am not yet concerned that current inflation will become a persistent threat, at least in the near-term. While that may change and I advise people to be ready in case the Fed is forced to tighten rates sooner-than-expected, I expect value and cyclicals to continue recovering as the US economy continues to reopen. With the stock market’s great performance in the last 12-14 months and government coronavirus stimulus, I expect savings-laden consumers to spend big this summer after being cooped up indoors for so long. 

Keith Lerner, Portfolio and Market Strategist at Truist Securities said, “The value trade is still intact. It got overcrowded, it got over-loved ... but when we look at the fundamental drivers behind that trade, they're still intact. So the first thing is, context. Yes, they had a big run this year, but they've trailed for about 14 years, so we've had a long underperformance cycle,"" he added. ""And the second part is, why did they underperform for so long is because we had really slow economic growth. And this year and next we expect above-trend economic growth. And the earnings momentum and the earnings leverage for these areas is still positive."" 

Later today, the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. **If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge if it happens.** 

On Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board

**Highlights**

* **As I was finishing the recap the news is out, the Fed is ending pandemic-era restriction on banks in stock buybacks and dividend increases.

* After being under pressure in recent months, shares of Tesla (TSLA) have begun rallying again, with the stock up more than 10% this week alone. 
* Today, Microsoft will unveil the long-awaited sequel to Windows 10. Windows 11, the product's first new version in almost six years, includes only limited changes to its visual design, but it seeks to reposition the operating system as a hub in a computing universe incorporating rival companies' platforms, including Android mobile software developed by Google and a digital storefront developed by Amazon (AMZN).[ Read more here ](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsofts-windows-11-reveal-event-every-upgrade-announced/)
* The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to approve the final piece of its six-part package, the ""Ending Platform Monopolies Act,"" which restricts big tech companies' ability to leverage their platform dominance to promote other lines of business and disadvantage competitors. The vote on the bill was 21-20. The bill will now move on to the House floor and, if passed there, the Senate. The bill is newsworthy but pretty much doomed to fail.
* Snapchat (SNAP) users globally will get access to Universal Music Group's library of recorded music and content for their own content-making on the social media platform, the companies said Thursday. This move comes as US social media companies across the board continue to implement more “TikTok-like” features. To show just how much TikTok has grown, parent company ByteDancehas a market cap of roughly $250 billion, almost $100 billion more than Snap and Twitter (TWTR) combined.

My favourite fact in the whole market right now is that VIAC is in the same business as NFLX,  has a comparable Library of content and has roughly the same annual revenue and profitability, but trade at 1/7 of the Price/Earnings ratio and 1/8 of the Price/Sales ratio of NFLX.

The book value per share of VIAC right now is 29.69$ so in the worst case scenario we can assume that the price won't go below 30$ which I think will not happen unless we have a financial crisis. In my opinion the price won't drop below 40$ again this year and if it drops to this price I will definitely YOLO all my portfolio into VIAC.

Growth is coming for VIAC, and what makes the things more interesting, VIAC is an attractive target for big whales, and any day soon we may here M&A news.

Finally I really believe that VIAC is undervalued in an overvalued market, and it has more room for growth with Paramount+ than its competitors, IMO in a normal market the price have to be 70$ but in this overvalued market it should be at least 100$

In the comments also I will add a link to a small comparison between VIAC streaming revenue and ROKU total revenue.

Market cap:

VIAC 28$B 🤯

ROKU 57$B

NFLX 223$B

TL;DR VIAC has just started to move and it is setting up for the mother of all breakouts, options volume confirms this, to the moon sooner or later 🚀🚀🌕🤞💰💰

I already started my position in the last dip, 100 share at 40.30$ and my exit price is 80.60$ and probably 100$ if the momentum will be high.

***Please note:*** *I've seen a lot of questions surrounding the analyst price target upgrades that I post, so I just wanted to clear some things up and explain my reasoning behind including them.*

*I frequently get asked if I think analyst price target predictions are ""accurate"" or if I expect a stock I mention to hit the price predicted.* ***The answer to both these questions is NO.*** 

*I really don't put much, if any importance, on the actual numbers predicted by an analyst. They are just a meter to gauge how bullish or bearish they are. My purpose in including price target upgrades is to find trends in analyst thinking. In other words, if I see a bunch of different, well-known analysts all giving bullish target increases on a stock, I'll start doing research on a stock to see why they are so bullish. I have found quite a few profitable trades in this manner.*

***In short, the purpose of the price target upgrades is idea generation. Keep an eye out if you start seeing the same stock receiving bullish target increases by different analysts.***

Stocks were mixed, but mostly positive today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) recording a fresh intraday high and the Dow Jones (DIA) nicely continuing its recovery after falling last week, driven higher by a boost in bank stocks across the board after the Fed removed all pandemic-era restrictions on capital distributions. The Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after several days of reaching new all-time highs. The core personal consumption expenditures, which serves as the Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation was released but did not adversely affect the market, another signal the market is prepared to stomach higher than usual inflationary readings as the economy continues to recover. 

The core PCE index measures the changes in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, minus volatile food and energy prices, which are staples and therefore not considered in the equation. The report registered a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, in-line with Wall Street estimates and marking the fastest jump since 1992. However, it is important to note that the report is still reflecting “base effects” as prices rebound from the pandemic-induced collapse last year. 

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve released the results of its “stress test” on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical “severely adverse” scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.

The results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs. To put in extent how much money this is, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters.

In other news, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. 

Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, “The way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme.""

**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY gapping up pre-market, QQQ is trading inside of Friday's range. Energy was the leading sector overall last week, Utilities closed out Friday the strongest though.  Retail Industries were the leading industries (Footwear & Accessories, Department Stores, Apparel Stores). Money is still flowing into solar although it's getting a bit extended.

Lots of good gapping charts this morning, many times this can signal a sell off in gaps at the open but when the market is very strong sometimes the gaps can hold and due to this I will have no bias as direction and will be looking to trade to both the Long and Short side.  Not many earnings being released this week so we will continue to rely on different catalysts to trade. Most of the time I do not pay attention to news or catalyst. I mainly want to know that the stock I am trading is not a cash buyout and that it has volume and liquidity. No catalyst can ever tell me a stock will go higher or lower. I am a technical trader and I trade patterns. Pay attention to volume and spreads. Be in the right places and manage risk and you should be alright. Good luck out there.

**Notes:** Here is a good video that explains Gaps and why they are important to Day Trading: [All about Gaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnWDa7GECuQ&t=1s)

\**I do not add stocks under $5. If there is a stock that is under $5 here, it was above $5 when I added it. The reason being is that most penny stocks halt which is very risky and they are also highly manipulated*\*

➥ Absolutely cracked looking chart. Textbook bull flag with a huge gap left at 30. May encounter some resistance around 18.60, but aside from that it's clear skies. If we're lucky we've also got ourselves a front row seat to a short squeeze too, since the short interest on this ticker is at 40%. If someone wants to writeup a DD on this stock and start pumping it across subreddits so apes and algos can pick up on it, be my guest. I'll look to take a position this week. Will be grabbing calls if we break the flag (probably around 16.40), and then selling / rolling them depending what happens at 18.60 (sell if we bounce, roll if we keep flying).

&nbsp;

[**$BIDU - 4 Hour Chart**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/809298208382910474/858879744581304330/bidu.png)

 ➥ Another really clean chart. We're sitting right at the 203/205 resistance, so calls are valid at any point above it. Will likely make a quick trip up to 223, then 228 if it starts running. Above that it's clear skis up to 264. The only reason I even included that is cause ROKU blew me out to the upside last week, and I don't wanna get pantsed again. I know many traders are eyeing this trade and the OI on it is fucking huge, so there may be some funny gamma action and MM fuckery w/ this one. Regardless, insanely clean technical setup.

&nbsp;

[**$PLTR - 4 Hour Chart**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/809298208382910474/858880137840164904/pltr.png)

➥ Our favourite meme stock makes a comeback! I initially didn't even notice the runup at first until someone on my Discord pointed it out, and I'm also hesitant to play PLTR cause I'm too fuckin' dumb, but the chart on it looks cute. If we get above 27.50 we likely fly to 30, since there's literally 0 resistances. There's alot of money to be made here, and similar to WKHS, it's a meme stock, so if it starts running, it *really* starts running.

&nbsp;


[**$XLF - 4 Hour Chart**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/809298208382910474/858882188527403038/xlf.png)

➥ Every single fuckin' bank stock more or less has the EXACT same chart, have a look if you don't believe me. As a result, I'm just gonna play XLF instead since I can make more money trading the ETF ([See my writeup on collateral trades for more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7c0wj/mitigating_risks_and_maximizing_returns_using/)). We're likely gonna run straight into 37.60 by close on Monday if I had to guess, but after that it's largely up to whatever numbers the banks release (probably priced in). To those who don't know, banks will be able to disclose their planned capital distributions after close, so that's gonna be the make or break for this play. Calls are good above 37.60, but don't be surprised if we randomly gap. Overhead resistances are located at 38.10 and 38.50.

oag4w5,19,13,wallstreetbets,Vizio DD - A less risky ROKU but at a steal of a price,0.62,1624997153.0,1624997153.0,"$VZIO is a mature device company. They currently sell smart TV's, soundbars, etc. That's fine and dandy, but in their recent IPO, 10K, and 8K they have made many mentions of their shift into the a much more lucrative space.

Vizio introduced Platform+, which includes a smart TV operating system called SmartCast and a data analytics service called Inscape. Similar to ROKU this allows individuals to stream whatever content they like on their TV. Again, the main difference is that ROKU is selling a $25 box vs. VZIO selling a $200 TV. That may sound scary but let's look at their Q1 highlights:

**Q12021 Highlights:**  
 •*Net revenue increased 52% year over year to $505.7 million*

*•Platform+ net revenue increased 120% year over year to $52.2 million*

 *•Adjusted EBITDA increased 218% year over year to $40.4 million*   
   
*•SmartCast Active Accounts grew 57% year over year to 13.4 million*

*•SmartCast Hours grew 70% year over year to 3.6 billion*

*•Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increased 76% year over year to $14.52*

  


Okay, so good financially and operationally - but are their TV sales growing?  
 

*Ranked #2 best-selling TV brand in the US during Q1 2021*

*Ranked #1 best-selling Sound Bar in the US during Q1 2021*  


As millennials and cheap old fucks continue to cut the cord, the $70 billion TV ad market will bleed into the streaming platforms that everyone is using.   


Yes, they are late to the game. But because Vizio is a name/brand we've all heard of and has massive market penetration already, if/when they can figure out their SmartCast monetization the associated revenue becomes a flip of the switch for them. $VZIO is targeting huge monetization opportunities in areas such as ad-supported video on demand, home screen advertising, and partner marketing.   


BY THE WAY:  Vizio currently has a partnership with Verizon. This partnership is a further advance towards enabling new cross-platform and CTV advertising solutions, with the help of Inscape's smart TV data.

As a cap off, take a look at this quick comparison. IMO either ROKU is incredibly overpriced or VZIO has a long way to run.
